For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8\/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I play games for fun not for competition so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops) and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with) then no biggie. Next game please I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.As a killer (a horrible one) I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up there is always the next game )That being said this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it have fun with it and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!) and even then recognize that there are jerks who play this game like any other game and have fun while you compete!","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

This review will consist of 5 sections and some sub sections.GameplayThis game consists of there being 4 survivor and one killer who must complete a series of objectives on a map. Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening doors. For its part the killers must pursue hang sacrifice or kill the survivors.Survivors and killers have the possibility to use perks objects accessories and offerings that help to give advantage within a game.Offers good mechanics for escaping the killer or catching the survivor as Pallets Windows 360's Moonwalks Hide Different powers in each killerThe balancing is one of the most difficult aspects of the game. Each update changes the balance making nerf or buff to the killer and survivors. In my opinion there are many things where the balancing is good. but there are many other things that fail a lot.Rating Balance 6\/10 Mechanical system 9\/10 Innovation 8\/10 Gameplay 8\/10Graphics It uses the graphic engine Unreal Engine 4 which is an engine with quite good lighting and easy to use with respect to other engines. In the graphic section optimization and animation Dead by Daylight is mediocre because there are enough graphic bugs or animation but it must be understood that Behaviour is not Epic game to be able to invest so much money in that aspect. Animation 6\/10 Optimization 5\/10 Graphics 6\/10 Matchmaking In this aspect the game has improved a lot these 2 years but it's still quite mediocre there are quite a few bugs in looking for killers and supervients. The worst thing is that the host is the killer and there are no servers. And besides the rank system fails a lot there are games that can touch you ranks 20 being rank 1.

If you're looking for scares I wouldn't consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time. It doesn't have enough build up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer. That said and set aside I enjoy a good chase or simply losing the killer's line of sight and giving them the slip. It can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock. There have been times where I have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden. Those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes. Hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right and it's one of the aspects that drew me to Dead by Daylight. It's a game about being sneaky and trying not to get caught. On the other hand however getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door. Contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting. As with any game I feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game and sometimes it's possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook which can be very not fun. I give Dead by Daylight an 8\/10 and I've enjoyed my many hours playing and so I will recommend.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Either side has a few things that infuriate the other (Decisive Strike and No One Escapes Death are the current front runners) and certain killers are notoriously overpowered or underpowered. Freddy Kreuger mains for instance must hate themselves to play that and Nurse mains must just hate playing the game fairly.New content is regular 1 killer 1 survivor 3 perks for each side and a map are released every 3 months or so mid chapter balance patches occur and cosmetics are regularly added.There are downsides however. While balance patches come regularly they won't do anything incremental. Freddy is ridiculously weak but they refuse to give him small quality of life changes that they have said he needs until they are ready to release a full rework of him. Meaning rather than sitting at a 'meh' stage he sits in boring weak and generally unfun.Pay to pay to keep paying. Buying the game will net you around half the cast. Many are also available through grinding however licensed killers and survivors require further payment. Their perks are also locked to you unless they are picked on the \"random\" weekly shrine. (The good ones rarely are.) On top of this despite in game currency being used for cosmetics anything they think looks good or will be popular is locked behind payment only. It's a move when you may have already spent upwards of $80 just to unlock characters.Awesome and incredibly angry community as you'd expect from a game like this.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Where killing requires significantly more concentration survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player but is often an M1 simulator if you dont involve yourself with the game much. This repetivity is very clear but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles and the killers have completely different \"powers\" which can tilt the game at any point. If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.I would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It's a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared. There is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn ingame but achieving the grind and getting the perks (massive game factor) that you want that will greatly change the way you play. It's just amazing and the game I turn on everyday for a good 6+ hours.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

There are alot of different languages available. You are able to play the game with a controller There is a mouse and controller sensitivity slidebar available. 0% 100% For Killer and survivor (both seperated). You are able to change the controls on the keyboard and controller. There is a manual Tutorial\/help\/tips available.About the game.You can choose between a Survivor or a killer. You are able to have 4 survivors in a match and 1 killer. Each side has an objective. The killer has to kill all 4 survivors in order to win while the survivors has to escape from the map. Survivors are using third person camera and killers are using a first person camera. Each survivor or a killer has their own level and perk system. So if you have unlocked an offering the offering can only be used in a match if you play that certain character.Survivors are able to use items and increase the effect of the item by adding add ons while the killer has a default power ability which can be improved by adding add ons. Offerings could be used to change the match or by gaining more points. The game is Trial and error and WILL BE DIFFICULT IN THE BEGINNING.While the game is pretty dark by itself you are able to increase the brightness by darkening your own room or increase the brightness on your computer monitor. This may have a little impact or no impact at all but if you are close to a window or the sun has the potential to shine into your room. You could be put in a disadvantage as you will have a hard time looking at the screen or able to see things properly. Killer needs to kill the 4 survivors in order to win. There are alot of different killers each with their own unique gameplay and perks. Some killers are able to go invisible or even stealth while other killers are using deadly tools to get their victims. The killer has a first person camera perspective which means he can't use their camera to look around the walls for victims. Killers are able to see ALL Generators and exit gates throughout the match which could help you locating survivors.You will have to hunt down the survivors and they could reveal themself on the map if they are failing a skillcheck helping a survivor off the hook or destroying a hex totem. Chasing a survivor will start the \"Chase music\" until the victim is down or escaped. An injured or a running survivor will leave a trail of red marks around the location which you need to track down in order to kill them. A killer is able to hear nearby \"grunting\/moaning\" sound when a survivor is injured. The killer is able to kick generators to slow and decrease the generator progress or destroying thrown pallets by kicking them. Killers are generally faster than a survivor and the killer's movement speed will increase the longer the chase goes as they have \"Bloodlust\". Survivor needs to escape from the map by completing generators to power up the exit gate or they are able to find a hatch. There are alot of different survivors each with their own gameplay and perks. Some are good for co op actions while others are quickly. Survivors have a third person camera which will allow them to see around the walls and keep the killer at a distance. You will have to find generators to power up the exit gates to make your escape.Generators are randomly spawned on the map and could be located by looking up as you will see sparky flashlights. From time to time you will receive a skillcheck which you will need to success in order to prevent the generator blowing up and able to reveal your location on the game. Blowing up generators will lose some of your progess and could put you into danger as well. By reparing enough generators the exit gates will be powered up and you COULD leave the area after opening the gates. You could also find a hatch which will allow you to escape but the killer is able to grab you out of the hatch if he is quick enough.There are 2 hitchecks on a skillcheck The thick white bar and a smaller bar. Before the skillcheck will pop up you will hear a \"ping\" sound. Hitting the Bigger white bar will gain you more experience and you will gain 2% more progress but you are better off focusing on the smaller bar as it will be alot easier to hit. Most actions ingame require a skillcheck and missing a skillcheck will reveal your location to the killer. You are able to find items in crates such a medkit or a toolbox. Items has a quality level and make them more powerful the higher it is. Items are usually an one time thing as you will lose them if you have died or they run out of charges. You are able to to carry an item to the next match if you have escaped.The survivor is able to jump over windows throw down pallets or hide in lockers. Lockers are not a good hiding location and you will be instantly grabbed by the killer if spotted. You are better off crouching and hiding behind obstactles. A common mistake what people are doing is Running. If they see a killer and it is close to a survivor they have a tendency to run which will be a big mistake as this will reveal your location to the killer alot easier. You should only start running when you are being chased or you know for sure the killer isn't close to you.Ingame Information. Moderate replayability. Good Atmosphere. Dark graphical horror atmosphere. Has Perks and level systems. Each survivor\/killer has their own system. Dialy randoms quests to gain an insane ammount of experience.Miscellaneous Information. Dwight and Nea are both good beginning characters. Worst enemies could be your allies while the killer could be your friend. Pallets are buggy Don't throw the pallet if you are facing it. It could teleport you to the other side and screw you over.Other things.The game isn't that fun as it may seem. Why? If you are playing as a killer you will fight against a bunch of \"high\" skilled trolls and they are usally pre made as well. They are mostly pallet\/window jumping flashlighting and shamefully t bagging.If you are playing as a survivor you will play against a killer that may be alot better than you are. Sometimes teammates are disconnecting in a middle of the match which will leave you in a disadvantage they also have the tendecies to really screw you over. Sometimes even on purpose.Survivors are generally alot more toxic salty trolly and generally have a negative attitude than a killer will ever get in this game. Killers mostly relies on mistakes from the survivors and sometimes are more friendlier than a survivor.I will only suggest to buy this game whenever it is in a discount. Otherwise i would suggest to stay away from it. The idea of the game is nice Community however isn't and can be really frustating or game ruining.I have reached the text review limit. T T '( Reviews are always uploaded if i have at least played for 2 hours or more.

Yeah they finally update the game and just make it worse for the survivor you can get 15 000 blood points in a single game but if you don't escape you don't get a pip. Also the other players you survive with most of the time at the end of the game will intentionally run the killer to you so they can escape and they let you die.

The theme and artistic guide of the game is horror but the game isn't scary. It's like when those youtubers play FNAF for views yet they look like they want to off themselves Dead by Daylight is not meant to scare you it's meant to challenge you.Now the game still holds incredible potential of fun. If you're a fan of the horror genre you're going to love the Dead by Daylight. The game features licensed killers from classic horror films like Leatherface Michael Meyers and remade version of Freddy Krueger (which imo is a piece of they added quentin instead of literally anybody else). The downside to this is that alot of these characters are locked behind an in game purchase door. You're gonna have to pay more money than the fee to start playing the game if you want to play the cool characters. The game holds a strong incentive to play. You level up your killers\/survivors you get cool perks you get cool items and you can also get prestige! If you like farming for completion this game will keep you occupied.Now the downside the game has all the issues other online games have. There is a serious balance issues however the devs are working on it and the game is more balanced than ever according to Dead by Daylight's subreddit. Playing survivor is literally playing baby mode while playing killer is like smashing your head against your keyboard. If you plan on playing with friends you can only play survivor unless you have enough for a full 1v4 but you will not earn any points for kill your friends gamemode. The community is also INCREDIBLY toxic. Toxic communities to me are a sign of an utterly unfun game for people become toxic because the game angers them so much. And that is true. While you may have good games occasionally you will also have terrible games and those trials will put your mind to hell. Think of the game similar to CS GO and LoL. Toxic community hard core disconnectors garbonzo matchmaking yada yada.In the end the game is still great. If you enjoy competitive games this will be your type of game. If you want a high skill ceiling game play killer. If you want to play by dragging your balls from left to right on your keyboard and still win play survivor.TL DRThe game is not for everyone but most people will enjoy it to some degree. By the way if you bm as a survivor you are the degenerate scum that deserves to get shot down in the streets.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The forums are filled with nothing but killers complaining about survivors being OP and survivors complaining about killers being OP.. Truth be told the game is fun when playing againsts a killer who is fair and doesn't tunnel the heck out of you or camp you. in the end the bad players make the game non fun.Pls add a block option so players can avoid killers\/survives who are either toxic or campers so they can avoid future matches with them tyKillers drop you when you thinking it will prevent you from struggling off their shoulder. NEWS it doesn't reset struggle timer. YOU tell survivors get good or you would not get hit or hooked. same goes to you if you have to use these tactics to win you're just unskilled or lazy.the pt system is so way off .. the killer if they do it right can leave easily with 40K plus pts this is even when they lazy and if a survive works their asses off they might get 20 to 30K? more often than not when using even bloody party streamers killer aims to kill as fast as possible and survivor leaves with 3K.That is if they are lucky but a killer is garenteed at least 12K if they only hook 2 survives.No wonders so many play killer .Wish they had a kill your friends that earned you bp and not ranks that would allow players to play for fun and skip being trolled by killers taking out non toxic players.Doing this as well will lower idiotic wait times for killers because it seems too many want to be \"evil\" just cause of event or it's easy bp and they having a bad day and want to take their negativity out on survives.Killers claim that survives are over powered but you got the doctor that has a ability that can hit survives pretty much a quarter if not more of the map.I am an unskilled killer who can down survives in second on the doctor if I chose. YOU got the pig who can pretty much have 0 terror radious sneak up on you add in the massive debuffsa then what the head trap. In the movie yes Amanda had to get it off alone because she was alone however in the game survives are NOT alone. Why not make someone get teammate get it off with the rule of them having to have a tool kit?I mean amanda didn't have a killer grabbing her while getting what she needed for the trap to come off. Due to killers tunneling the hell out of you there is no way to get it off your head unless the pig doesn't tunnel.I have had 10 pig killers troll the fk out of me .I see pig I will leave the game or just die on first hook. PIG induces toxic killers .I am not a sore loser give me fair game play without tunnel or camping I am happy win or lose. survives can be as toxic as well.A game should be fun competetive or not in the end we all here to enjoy a game. Some want to have all wins that is okay too but that isn't gonna happen. If you lose fairly respect that.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Sure it has a ton of bugs but its not like its the only game that has bugs. This game (Though it isn't in beta) is still a work in progress with a complex leveling system and new things being added every few weeks or so. Saying \"THIS GAME HAS TOO MANY BUGS\" is like saying \"MARIO IS TOO 3D.\" It's part of the game. Reporting a bug won't fix it right away. The Devs need some time to make the patch and program the game.To all of y'all who think you can do better than the Devs why don't you try to satisfy WAY over 10 000 people worldwide. THESE GAMES AREN'T EXACTLY EASY TO MAKE. So everyone who doesn't recommend this game JUST BECAUSE OF THE FREAKIN' BUGS why don't you go to a tech university or college and why don't you study programing. Then I would like to see how far anything that you make goes. Bugs in games aren't intentional. They are programing\/ modeling errors. Every game is TRIAL AND ERROR.Grand Theft Auto had a ton of bugs rockstar fixed it. Super Smash Bros had a ton of bugs and nintendo fixed it. Don't you think the devs will try to fix the bugs in this game? Yes they will. Even if it take months.This game is fun and a few bugs here and there might ruin one or two rounds but I don't think its fair that you don't recommend this game because you're salty you can't win a match. Whether you being a killer and the hook is blocked or being a survivor floating in the air for the killer to see.

How would you feel hiding behind a corner hoping nothing is lurking just around it? How exhilerating is it when you find your victim and you give chase?This is what this game explores and it does so perfectly! The simplified UI as to not distract you from the hunt relying solely on audio cues (with a little extra help for the killer since they are supposed to be supernatural) to navigate the little area.They play the suspense role flawlessly you are at the edge of your seat when you start running (whether you are running to kill or avoid being killed.)I highly recommend this game to anyone into the horror genre! It does get repetitive and I am starting to have trouble finding the motivation to keep playing the same maps over and over again. However this is certainly something that I will open back up every October!","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2016-06-14","funny":1,"helpful":1,"hour_played":322,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"Dead by Daylight is a very interesting game. Bringing us into the land of Slasher horror films. Something not a lot of games venture into if at all.You can play as a Slasher or a Survivor. Survivors have a third person perspective and have audio cues to know if the Slasher is close but not its exact position. A small red light on the ground shows the Killer's vision letting you know the Killer is RIGHT behind you when you're being chased if you even DARE to look back. When you're being chased the Slasher is slightly faster. But this is balanced out with ways to avoid the killer. Throwing down pallets to block him while you run off in tall grass or hide in a closet or something. Your objective is to activate 5 generators with 3 other survivors and then escape. Sounds simple but it's a lot harder than it sounds. There is no voice chat in ranked matches so plans cannot be made.There are three Slashers each with different abilities. You have the Trapper who uses Bear Traps to trap survivors in choke points during chases or stop them getting to the generators from helping survivors etc. The Wraith who has a cloaking ability. Many users are complaining that this slasher is Overpowered. The cloaking prevents survivors from hearing the audio cue that plays when the Slasher is near. However before the Wraith can go invisible a bell toll plays announcing that he's cloaking. Players then have the option of continuing what they're doing or be more careful.Then you have the Hillbilly that has a Chainsaw dash ability able to cut down a survivor in one fell swoop.All three of the Slashers have a melee weapon that takes down a survivor in two hits. One makes them bleed two downs them to a crawl. When slashing there's a slight cooldown for when you hit a survivor. When you hit a survivor the Slasher wipes the blood onto his sleeve and he slows down for a few seconds allowing the Survivor to get a headstart. Fair trade in my opineon. If the slasher was able to do two swings in rapid succession it wouldn't be very fair.The goal of the Slasher no matter the type is to either kill or sacrifice all the Survivors by putting them on meat hooks. Once again this is harder than it sounds. Survivors can help eachother getting others off meathooks healing eachother helping repair the Generators etc.The game has one core gameplay mode but two ways to do it. Ranked is as simple as it sounds. Play as a Slasher or Survivor against random online people. Or you can do Kill Your Friends mode which is the same but in a private match for at least 2 people(One person HAS to be the Slasher). Now the big difference between the two. In ranked mode you score blood points which you can use to upgrade your character. Give them new perks and items to use. However in Kill Your Friends this stuff is blocked. I'm guessing this is mainly to stop people from farming points. If this is something that bothers you you might not want to spend money on this. Be warned.Speaking of points. There is a character customization point or loadout. Which allows you to add items to your character.(As stated above) There's not many choices of clothing and cosmetics as of yet. This is likely to be added in future updates along with new play modes.Maps are of relatively medium to large size all of which are dark and forboding and are procedurally generated. Generators in a place you might know now will be switched in different plays.I think this game is quite fun and is a pretty good horror game that will make you tense up.Price is pretty damn low for something of this kind of quality only $20. Ten dollars more if you want the Deluxe edition.Go ahead and get this game if you wish and enjoy yourself you masochistic maniac you.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Only cons that stand out are it takes awhile to find a game and the wraith seems better than the other 2 killers.

The largest problem i have with it is it takes FOREVER to find a game as a killer.edit it seems that more people are playing this game now so it is much faster to find a game now.edit 2 the escape hatch really needs some rebalancing. right now it is practicly a guarantee that the last survivor will escape. if they made it so the hatch only opened if there is only 1 or 2 generators left or made it so it does not open at all but make the key to it more common to find i think it would feel a bit more balanced.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The game is so much better than it was when I originally reviewed it and still much better after I edited my initial review. I'm gonna keep the old review in but in parenthesis. That review is outdated but feel free to read it.Since the dead by daylight team at bhvr seperated from starbreeze I have been nothing but impressed. They have a very voherent plan laid out for their game and it seems like they are actually focusing on making a game they love rather than making it for money. The changes are well welcomed the balance changes were much needed and the pallet changes are excellent. Most of the negative reviews you will see on this game recently are people very upset about the balance changes. The balance changes have actually made things more balanced and they don't like it because they aren't as good anymore. Which is understandable since if you bought the game for that reason and don't get that feeling anymore I would also be disappointed but you also have to realise this is more how the game was envisioned.The community for this game is to be honest terrible. Only in rust have I seen a community more toxic and abysmal than the Dead by Daylight community. However the game is still extremely enjoyable and fun and you can also just hide the chat so you don't have to deal with people. All in all this game is easily one of my favorites and I only see it getting better in the future.However I still stand fully by my statement that the doctor is the actual worst part of any video game I have EVER played. But that's just an opinion.TL DR This game is fun the community is the devs are working on making the game a better experience and I couldn't be happier with the direction they're going.8\/10 OUTDATED REVIEW BELOW (This game is very fun though also extremely frustrating due to mechanics and the way players interpret those mechanics into some less than fun playstyles. The game has always been fun but i would not have reccommended it back when i first got the game or even just a few months ago. i believe that with the seperation from starbreeze bhvr can really make this game into something great that i know it can be and so far from what ive seen in te dev streams and the roadmap they're pushing for that as well. It is by no means a perfect game and they refuse to patch the biggest bug in the entire game (The Doctor) but it is an enjoyable experience when you can get past all the upset people telling you to off yourself.)","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Each update breaks more than it fixes and the devs have given up on listening to the community whatsoever. Communication between the devs and community was already pretty bad but now they just pump out awful buffs and nerfs that usually aren't needed cuz it seems like they listen to the extremely loud whiners rather than looking at the data and proper feedback. The gameplay has become stale frustrating unfair and not worth playing. DLC is heavily overpriced and is usually nothing good maybe a new killer that's overpowered and eventually gets a nerf or some crappy accessories.

You can feel the thrill being chased by the killer when playing as a survivor and one match doesn't take time too long even though this game is a PvP game.the cons are the matchmaking system is weird and maybe i spent 60% of my total playtime in game just to search matches. But i can still tolerate it because if you actually know when to play it doesn't take time that long. But the real prob is everytime this game releases a new patch and you update the game it becomes worse for no reason. On the first patch my fps dropped from 40 50 to around 20 30 and after i updated the latest patch(today's patch). The game becomes literally unplayable. i can't even get into the main menu. the game tells me to verify the game but it fixes nothing.

The game is pretty well made and pretty well balanced. It's difficult to survive as a survivor and to kill as the killer so it does all even out although some of the DLC killers are OP and a little unfair IMO. As the survivor you have to repair generators open the exits and run around\/hide trying to avoid the killer... as the killer you just need to stop the survivors and put up with being called a camper no matter how far away you go from your hooked victims. Seriously the community is salty... VERY salty... The game can be a little repetitive but because of all the unlocks it does have good replayability and so I would recommend the game. However be aware the community is pretty toxic and it is very frustrating to play at times.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Can be fun to play both solo and with friends. High tactical and mechanical skill cap. Don't get me wrong it's got its bugs but it is very clear that the devs are actively working to patch and rebalance the game while also consistently adding new content to the game.One major issue with the game is the \"loss of save file\" bug. THIS CAN BE PREVENTED by manually backing up your save files every so often (just a simple copy\/paste). However I disregarded this advice myself only to lose 225 hours of progress when the Steam servers went down. I proceeded to email the devs to resolve the issue. After about two weeks I finally got all my progress back. I was also able to continue playing in the meantime and got to keep any bloodpoints I had earned in that period. I admire the developers of this game for actually taking the time to look into such issues and keeping in contact with their playerbase as so many other small studios fail to do.Update 310 hours in and this game is still great. Devs continue to do their best to balance everything.TL DR If you want a competetive tactical 4v1 game definitely consider this. Devs do a really good job with updates and communication.

Never mind the 450+ hours I ve clocked but the entire experience has been dreadful i've never played a game that frustrates me as much as this one. From killers camping &amp wrecking the game survivors simply disconnecting randomly when they sense they're gonna lose you name it.1.) Firstly they have this stupid Season Reset system which resets player's Ranks every so often. What this means is that everyone essentially starts back at Rank 16 20. So a person with 3 000 hours as a killer may face 3 4 survivors with 50+ hours and annihilate the game (and vice versa). This creates a very unfair game and you would want to quit as a new starter.2.) Unlike other team games (like TF2) where you can still carry across if you end up with dudd player or 2 (from the 4) this game heavily relies on ALL 4 so if you have a bad one in your team you'll most likely all end up dead3.) The Devs seem to Buff &amp Nerf various killers\/survivors very frequently you can never master a player without either that playing being buffed or nerfed. This shows that after 2 years the game is imbalanced.4.) They try and discourage the killers from camping however they create perks that simply promote it like Dying Light where you have to kill 1 specific survivor to gain an advantage.Sorry for the new comers who don't understand some of the points above as they're specific but don't spend $19.99 unless you've played imbalanced games and happy to try and have fun.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Everything about the game is excellent asthetically there are some questionable underlying gameplay issues that leave room for improvement. The premise of the game is wonderful 4 defenseless survivors have to hide and attempt escape from a powerful supernatural killer. The game is an entertainment experience that fills me with a variety of feelings and emotions (mostly panic and fear). The music is intense and erratic adding to the feeling of hectic hopelessness. The environments are dark and dingy and the random spawn locations adds to the feeling of isolation. The sound of the approaching killer and the slaughter of a nearby teammate causes involuntary clenching that I rarely experience from video games. DbD is wildly fun to play with some friends as you can either be extremely goal oriented to work together to try and escape or you can play to rescue each other and try to create some highlights that belong on ESPN. There are some balancing issues with the various perks and attachments available to players but that is to be expected with any \"competetive\" player vs player game. The developers are much better now at acknowledging these issues and fixing them in a relatively timely matter. Overall I would highly recommend this game especially if you can pick it up for a decent sale price!","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2017-06-23","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":169,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"If you have a bad temper I wouldn't recommend this game. There's so many camping killers and selfish survivors. I think the game mechanics are too reliant on your perks and fellow survivors where as without the proper perk you cant heal after being injured nor can you escape the hook without another survivor saving which they can take advantage of you and use you as a diversion\/sacrifice to espace on their own and get their extra XP.What I have to say for the future of the game's development is that The killer shouldn't be allowed without 2 feet of a hanging body unless another survivors enters the invisible barrier while the killer is allowed to enter the invisible barrier upon the other survivor entering where the killer may hack at the hanged survivor's savior or go after the pre hanged survivor to finish them off. While I think the hanged victim should remain immue while in the invisible barrier of the hook to avoid campers to constantly pick them of. But if the previously hanged victim remains in the invisible barrier for more than 10 seconds the invisible barrier vanishes and the killer is free to go all in at the survivor. However the survivor's savior will not be immune while in this barrier if the killer is within 1 foot of them.In the most recent update for Dead By Daylight's Anniversary Match Making took a major turn for the better. I used to queue up with 3 friends and it took 2 hours for us to find a match. Developers finally patched this and match making is quicer and it's much more reliable if you want to have a quick match then having to find friends to create a private match with.I personally think the bugging and some of the dlc killers need to be patched\/fixed because things such as Michael Myer's not having a heartbeat outside of stalking and The Hag's teleport is just ridiculous and overpowered. I also think Michael Myers and The Hag's speed should be lowered some I was one shot by a Michael Myers while he chased for for bout 3 seconds as he hung my body my friend came to save me as she was also one shot. One game with the hag I was found at the beginning of the game where the hag used her incredible speed to catch me and knock me down as she hung me She camped me. Meg Thomas and William \"Bill\" Overbeck had both been knocked down attempting to save me as the other survivor cowarded out as The Hag hung and killed each of us off one by one.I would recommend because overall it's a fun experience expect for when you want to win and you get camped by a bunch a s. I wouldn't recommend it if you don't want to play a game that's so early in development and hasnt had time to reach it's full potential. If you are here to simply have fun and enjoy the experience of Dead By Daylight as the game rises to greatness then this is the game for you.Good Luck don't get slaughtered!","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

But as I ranked up players stoped using cheap tactics and overall the toxicity subsided. It's an interesting concept with the killer using various abilities (depending on the killer) to hunt down survivors and hang them on hooks. This is a big deal since there's only 4 survivors killing them as soon as you catch them all the time would make the game to fast. Speaking of survivors they have to power 5 generators (which they all somehow know how to do) to open a door and escape. After all the generators are done there's still the matter of opening the doors. This was pretty clever of the devs. Just because the exit is there dosen't mean the killer can't stop you. You could be right there in front of the exit but a fellow survivor is stuck on a hook. You can either leave the game (and get salt) or risk your life. Many people say gens progress too fast. But I say it's a good choice. DbD has no way of chatting mid game unless you use something like Discord or Skype so coordinating outside of a private chat is hard. Faster gens will compensate for that.I have two problems with this game however. One problem is what the devs are doing with this game. They said they're not dealing with scummy tactics like face camping (Staying right by a hooked survivor) or pallet looping (dropping a pallet to block the killer and just leaping over it whenever the killer gets to close.) Though if you have a group of friends to play with (which I don't ) you can work around face campers and with pallet looping you can just ignore the troll and partol some generators.My 2nd problem is the community. Both killer mains and survivor mains alike can be annoying. While killers are usualy ok there's a camper every now and then that will just tell you git gud. Survivors are even worse in my opinion. A toxic survivor will usualy get mad at \"camping\" (which to them is just staying on the same half of the map as a hooked survivor.) And act like they're compleatly innocent. This is never the case. Suvivors can be found palletlooping windowlooping flashlight spamming bodyblocking etc. while asking for respect the whole time. A toxic survivor can easily be compared to a spoiled 6 8 year old brat. However the community is a mixed bag. Every now and then you get paired with a fair respectable group that are good winners and losers. Those kinds of games always make my day no matter how well I actully preform in the match.All in all DbD is a pretty good horror survival game that you can pour many hours into. I reccomend it.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It could be Paragon...it's crap...but a 6 because it is sufficient to enjoy the game (SUFFICIENT).AUDIO The music itself is ok nothing too good nothing too bad but all the tiny details the screams the footsteps and more it makes the experience really enjoyable but doesn't excell.GAMEPLAY Funny and addictive probably at long it will get boring as Survivors doesn't have any ability other than run and Killers has just 1 ability that most of the time is crap. I would like few more abilities like a moba but still the game is enjoyable and I keep playing and want to play more so is more than ok.I have to admit that the matchmaking is somehow broken (doesn't exist) and sometimes as a beginner I find myself against people that played probably for months (you can see that from the PERKS they have PERKS are items that increase your performance and you get them levelling up).This for now didn't ruin my experience I took it as it is sometimes the game is harder (they have more level) sometimes easyer (I do) no matter what you will take your experience (bloodpoints) to get level and sometimes is fun to try to beat someone stronger than you (and sometimes it happen and is SO GOOD).COMMUNITY Everyone in other reviews blame the toxic community...HOW? There is no in game chat of any kind you start a game you end a game you leave! At the start and end of a game you can chat IF YOU WANT and the few times I did everyone was nice (nice game gg had fun and so on).If people think that this is a toxic community probably they never tried League of Legend or any moba in general!Then of course unskilled players will always complain and blame on others....they are everywhere! There are people complaining about camping (Killer stay at the hang after hanged a survivor waiting for his death) and sometimes I do that...sometimes survivors got away with that grouping up using items (flashlight that blind the killer and more) and this is how it should be played but noobs doesn't know how to do that and blame the killer...just noobs being noobs!Still community is ok (I even posted on the community site here on Steam and they answered in a really polite way explaining me few things of the game).PRICE FOR THE VALUE 12.99 when on offer 19.99 full price...I pay that when I go out for a dinner few hours and what I eat will become poop ... for the fun I had until now I am already ok and happy to have paid those money.OVERALL Great game probably not for all I didn't meet any of the problems that blamers wrote in other reviews.I had really few problems with the lobby (maybe 10 times I click on start game and after less than 30 seconds I am back to the main menu) but is nothing that ruined at all my experience with the game.Probably who blame about it has crappy computer or internet connection often happens I work in customer service and \"why I can't use your software on facebook everything works fine so my internet is great\"...it's their problem and they should get a decent computer and internet connection before playing games online...or they should go playing with a console maybe offline thou...the game WORKS PERFECTLY.All my games as survivor or as killer starts in less than a minute (well lets say 2 minutes as after the game has to load and that takes usually longer than the waiting for a full lobby).That about the lobby sometimes (1 out of 5 maybe) as the game session rely on one host (that is a player) the game become laggy almost unplayable (well totally unpleyable) just die get anyway a little experience and start a new game worst case scenario will take 10 minutes.Overall this game worth to be played absolutly worth the price and it works fine.If you do not like survival horror or multiplayer game leave this game be otherwise really try it worst case scenario you trashed 12.99 (but I am sure that most of you attracted by this game will enjoy it ... people who will not enjoy it would not even have the doubt to buy it or not).All this people blaming this game for internet connection and stuff should try a triple A game 69.99 like For Honor where there are way more connectivity issues and bug on a 5 times the price game from a such famous publisher (damn you Ubisoft....damn you).","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I started from the very beginning with just three killers and four survivors. I've been through every DLC update community outburst and horrible patch update. I can say for sure that this game is absolutely worth it to play. The recent anniversary event was fantastic and brought a lot of people back including myself. The developers have actually improved themselves and listen to the community much better than they did before. Now I look forward to patch updates. They constantly add new map variations to old maps which is a very nice addition to the game. They also ACTUALLY FIXED the horrible queueing system from the past! They also added loading bars which provides so much clarity in case you do crash. With different promises such as console releases a new chapter for free coming up and community support there is no better time to pick this game up. It's also a very reasonable price gate to begin playing at $20 without sales.Simply put this game is just extremely fun. There is something really addicting about running away from the killer or murdering every survivor on the map. The problem was in the past the developers were hurting the game's growth through different means. Now it can't be farther from the truth.Is this game perfect? ABSOLUTELY NOT. There are still a lot of bugs peer to peer connection and face camping.Even with the flaws I recommend you pick this game up. Before I couldn't say this with certainty. Now I can. You won't regret it.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2017-07-02","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":82,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Not Recommended","review":"I definitely can't recommend this game. The premise and even the gameplay are incredibly compelling but execution is sloppy on so many fronts.Icons numbers and game concepts are explained so vaguely (or not at all) in game that it's difficult to grasp intricacies beyond the basic premise. The wiki has more detail but it's not always enough. It can be helpful to play as a survivor or killer to learn their special abilities but if they're behind the DLC paywall you might never really understand exactly how they work.There are a lot of game design choices that feel bad. If you take items with you on a round you'll lose them always if you're the killer and if you die as a survivor. Since it's impossible to know before a match begins whether it will be a close fight or a struggle for either side there's not much in the way of tactics when making the decision to bring gear along. So most of the progress through the bloodweb is transient and not very meaningful.There's no meaningful matchmaking. I've played with teams of all first time playing level 5 rank 20 survivors and ended up in games with rank 1 killers sporting huge perk and add on loadouts. What a terrible experience to expose new players to. The last game I played the killer took out 3 of us and then proceeded to carry the last survivor around the map holding the player hostage for 15 20 minutes while they racked up points. The player might wiggle free only to be chased struck down and carried back again once more. Since none of the generators were on the trap door wasn't available and there was no way for the player to escape or finish the job due to the killer's detection perks. Without any sort of time limit or event to break long term stalemates players have only two options wait until their opponent gets bored or disconnect and suffer huge point losses.The software decisions are really sloppy. Finish a game with friends? Your party is disbanded and you are put into a different game mode. Have a killer quit your lobby? Your party is disbanded. Temporary connectivity issue with the servers while trying to load a game? The game shuts down entirely. Accidentally get disconnected from the game? No way to reconnect. Interacting with the game is a chore.Fun trick about the game shutting itself down if you wait a few seconds after it tells you it needs to shut down and asks you to click \"Ok\" you can instead hit Alt F4 which will pull up an \"Are you sure you want to quit\" dialogue instead. On that dialogue you can hit cancel and skip the whole automatic restart thing which merely confirms that there was no reason for the game to shut down in the first place.This game *is* a lot of fun if you can find 5 friends of similar skill and experience to play it with together. Of course this requires dropping a collective $60+ on a title that doesn't have much value outside of that very specific use case. The rest of it is pretty thoroughly bad though. A pity too since the core of the gameplay though simple is very compelling.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2016-07-03","funny":1,"helpful":2,"hour_played":170,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"Positives The killer and survivor designs play styles and perks. The map designs and artwork. The fear the game's music and atmosphere creates for the survivors. Controls are simple and easy to learn. Gameplay (when the game works as intended) is fun for the killer and intense and scary for the survivors.Negatives Current gameplay is buggy at times. The game should have remained in early access for a few more weeks. There is no Looking for Group option at this time. You can either queue for randoms and click back and re queue until you find your friends or you can play a game with your friends but without a full party (unless you have the friends to create a full party). I definitely recommend this game to people but anyone playing should expect bugs ranging from funny (survivors floating through the air instead of running) to game breaking (survivors stuck in trees after being saved from the hook). The DBD devs are working out these kinks and have already released 2 patches and multiple hotfixes since the game's release earlier this month.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The gameplay is nearly solid with a few screw ups. such as range of weapons (for example getting hit while already vaulted away from a window and was a step away from the opening) thats about it.Pros! great soundtrack Very VERY fun with friends the character design is wonderful. The killers have this nice familiar but original feel to them. Map design is IN my opinion great! the perks and addons for each character cand really help you out at times! Cons! Rarely you are randomly kicked out of a match with no reason told Nurse is just annoying not really a bad con (It can be avoided easily if your a regular to dodging the hunnies) it would actually be cool to have some seperate lobby music. something similar to what it is now. but i like the song so much i dont want to hear it over and over again and get bored. (but it does have a very long runtime and has awesome sounding parts so its not just an annoying short loop. The game is a very fun game to me and i dont think it deserves all this hate!sure the matchmaking connectivity can be a little annoying. but its just because its free weekend currently. and its pairing you with squads of survivors who can be people in 3s looking for 1 more person or a squad of 2 looking for 2 more. just a player group complaint and i cant say thats a bad game bug or design. its mostly player complaint.I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME WITH ALL MY HEART","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Survivors are rewarded for working with each other and aiding in progression to the exit gates. Gameplay is made dynamic through different killers survivors maps and a large assortment of perks to suit your playstyle.Gameplay Very fun to play with friends and a pleasure to play solo as well. You're always a winner whether you successfully escape the killer or not promoting a style of gameplay that almost completely excludes selfish plays (you can't really do much about the purposefully selfish players). Teamwork is essential to survivng this game and with over 200 hours in this game I'm always on edge waiting for the killer to sneak up on me.Servers In a previous iteration of this review I commented on terrible MM which seems to be fixed now. Buying into this game you are not presently getting dedicated servers which means your gameplay is dependent on how good the host's connection is. A lot of the time this isn't a problem and the gameplay is enjoyable","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The new hunter \"The Shade\" is faster than the other hunters and is way to op this is imparitive and needs to change immediately. (2). The new map that came with the halloween dlc is small which is fine but they put the same amount of hooks from the other maps in the small map this makes it very hard to not get caught by the hunter. (3). I've noticed that hunters ranging from rank 1 rank 20 have been camping the runners when on the hooks this is making the game not fun anymore. when the hunters are camping they should have a penalty to some degree. (4). The hunters that camp and hook the last person want to get rid of \"Survive with Friends\" . If this happens then it will almost make the game impossible to play with friends. Please do not get rid of Survive With Friends.Until these changes are met I cannot recommend this game.*Update*Im glad the developers did not get rid of Survive with Friends but 9 out of 10 killers are still camping and it seems that with every single update and \"expansion\" the devs are making the killers faster and faster also this is a note to the devs \"Stop making the killers faster and stop listening to the players that only play killer\".","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The higher ranks don't complain much because they have perks to counter Freddy.

Even worse than Overwatch. Everybody is just rude and cancerous. Nobody respects people anymore. When I first got the game I guess I was in a small zen period when people are nice. Now it's just toxic\/salty survivors and killers\/survivors.2) The GameplayThe gameplay isn't bad at all. It's just when it comes to Killer v. Survivor. Survivor has so many better options to survive than the killer but the killer has so many cancerous methods that ruin the game for everyone. The balancing for killer\/survivor is not good. Survivors are OP AF devs. Pleae fix this.The main problem this game is bad is because of the SWF ( Survive With Friends ) Mode. It allows friends to tag along and go against killers with friends but the problem is the toxicity of these SWF games ruins the entire game. If they lose they get salty and triggered accuse you of being and trash talk. If they win the STILL TRASH TALK.3) The Perks + ItemsPerks are unbalanced as . Survivors just keep getting buffed and killers just keep getting nerfed. All because the opinions of the new players who say everything on killer is OP. And the devs of the game ACTUALLY LISTEN TO IT. I can't play killer anymore 1\/2 the time because i'll get put against somebody who is so much better than their rank. When ranks reset it destroy's everything about this game. P3 people with over thousands of hours get put against people with less than 100. It destroys the game makes them salty makes the devs nerf killer and make the game even more unbalanced than it already is!Survivor items are also way better than killer addons and stuff as well. Nothing more to be said.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. Played it for an hour. Regret buying it.As a survivor there's no real reward in completing generators. Sure you just move on to the next one (where there's 5 in total) and so on. Whenever the killer gets you there is a \"Press to wiggle\" function. This gives you a chance to break free from the killer and escape. He then drags your over to a hook. where he will impel you untill a survior comes to your aid. It would've been a great feature if the hooks weren't 2 inches from each other. And if you are new to the game and are a low level character there's not much fun in it for you. You have to grind and grind your character to a certain level before you can start to have a slight of a chance. And those perks includes things like tool boxes which makes you repair generators faster a simple flashlight so you can see! and so on. This game introduces itself in the worst way. Looks like fun when you watch someone else play it. And it doesn't explain you that you need to put hours into it before you can perhaps enjoy it.

This game is a lot of fun.You need a thick skin to play killer you will always have salty survivors you killed being toxic. BUT if you play this game with the intention of it being for fun and dont care about dying or about making sure someone dies on a hook (camping) then this game is a whole lot of fun. Try it you might just love it.Nov 2016 This game all depends on your outlook. If you are easily triggered by other players features in a game that make it unfair or developers that dont fix issues that are underlying in the game (camping Infinites etc) then this game wont be for you.Its got issues which are slowly being worked out. There should be a patch on the day I am writing this review to lessen the grind for perks and prestige. HOWEVER if you play this game for fun (and not too focused on getting points or the full win) then this game is fantastic. If you play the game how the devs envisioned it to be played (its not too hard to work out what the wanted dont be a and ruin the game for other people i.e camping) then this game is very good fun especially with teammates. You must have a thick skin though and be prepared to ignore the salt that happens at the end of every game from the people that will whine at you.

I bought this game while it was on sale a week ago and as soon as I played it I \"screamed\" with horror and joy. There was finally a horror game I could play with friends and have fun with. However once I started playing more I noticed some killers seemed a tier above others and completely overpowered. So I looked at the list of killers and soon realized that those characters were the ones you had to buy. I initially shrugged it off and thought maybe it was just coincidence that those were the ones always beating my friends and me. But the more we played the more I saw the trend of us losing to these \"pay to win\" killers. You would run into someone who has over 400 hrs in game but were low rank with these killers and being new players to this game we would get creamed.Now I know it isn't all fair with the normal killers so I think things should change there but my gosh the skill difference between these paid killers and normal survivors (especially for new players) can just ruin the entire game! I mean it gets pretty annoying when you have Michael Meyers slashing you from 4 ft away and follow you through every obstacle and gaining on you to be killed. Then have the killer at the end of the game calling you \"an alternative name for a cat\" and to do better (even though he has 500 hrs in game and ranked the lowest you can be).Honestly I would rather watch Zombeavers than play a potentially great horror game.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It is intended that the survivors must hide or work together to outwit the killer not just use \"infinite juke spots\" where it is quite impossible as killer to stop or catch the survivors.This makes the killer to suddenly completely miserable it is a bad section of \"Tom and Jarry\" a stupid hunter being ridiculed by a small mouse and it's not the one compares measurements with a dangerous killer.It makes me sad because it's a great game right up to this point and I would like to see it done otherwise I do not think it can develop more and probably ends when the other games in the same genre is released.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It is so blatantly obvious that the devs wanted to cash in on some quick bucks with an unfinished game. It's fun if you have a group of 4 friends to play this game with.

It feels like I'm trying to enter a club and I don't meet the proper requirements when I start. This would be less of a bother if I had ai bots to fail in front of a proper tutorial or at the very least a method of organizing players by their ranks so I'd fail as much as everyone else. This game has none of the above. (IF it does have a method of organizing players by rank then it seems awfully strange how everyone is already at their top ranks and nobody seems to be new to this at all considering how I was just dropped in the middle of expirienced players. Twice.) As a killer you can't just kill a survivor. You'll have to attack the survivor then drag his\/her body to a meat hook HOPING that another survivor didn't break it all within a certain period of time. I've been told that you CAN kill a downed survivor if you can find a \"memento\" which I find to be completely rediculous. If you're a killer aren't you supposed to.....well kill people!?As a survivor fixing a generator requires a quicktime action. Because the developers will not have mentioned this ANYWHERE you will most likely fail the first time you touch a generator and either get slaughered because of it or hurt your team's chances at survival because of it.This isn't tf2 pd2 csgo etc. where you can fail in front of ai bots or recieve proper tutorials. This is a polished yet unfinished game that you have to pay for in more than one way. It MIGHT improve over time but as of now I wouldn't recommend you play it at all unless if you know 2 3 other people who also play it.If you want a good slasher game where you play as the killer I'd recommend \"Party Hard\". It's storyline is decent most of your attacks are stealthy and strategic and the best part You aren't expected to know what you're doing before you're supposed to know what you're doing.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

As the hooked survivor is hanging and being camped you will have plenty of time to repair generators.Why should I buy this game? Dead by Daylight has unlimited playablility. While the objective is the same it never feels repetitive to me. Just like CSGO or any other game. If you want to sink your heart and soul into a game Dead by Daylight may be the game for you.

That alone should be saying something. (I was job hunting and had plenty of time alas those days are over)I could write a 10 page review on this marvelous masterpiece but I will keep it short and sweet This is why you NEED to buy Dead by Daylight.Best 18 20 bucks I've spent in AWHILE. As a lifelong gamer I really can say this is a top 10 favorite.The pros ++ The music and sound effects alone make the experience literally get your heart beating faster. Hell I think it even boosts your metabolism because of how on edge you can become.+ The game looks pretty cool. I like the style of landcape etc. The maps they have now 3 main areas with smaller sub areas are incredible as they are now but there are still updates and new maps in the future. I've played easily over 100 matches and in 3 maps I can say with confidence that it has NOT gotten old. I'm really impressed as being someone who plays everything from Dark Souls to Elder Scrolls to Fallout.+ If you are like me and loved hide and seek and tag when you were a kid and also now you'll love this because basically this is a \"grown up\" version of that game.+ The team aspect is excellent. Banding together makes repairing healing and basically ensuring your survival a lot easier and it doesn't feel poorly done or forced. I usually like working alone but this game really makes the working with others aspect appealing.+ The items\/loadout works very well. Plenty of offerings to put forward and the items available are straight to the point.+ The stealth aspect and hiding behind objects etc. works nearly flawlessly and the feeling you get when the killer runs RIGHT BY you is unparalleled.+ The multiplayer aspect plus the ability to play with friends makes it that much more entertaining.Negatives Several glitches even in the introductory part of the game while you are waiting in the lobby. That one can be overcome but then there's some really frustrating ones in game especially if the killer's internet is because you rubber band all over or it's choppy and there's lag delays. Although I love the 3 maps I would definitely say more maps would definitely not be out of the question.I'd love to answer any Qs you may have as I almost literally know this game inside out!","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

This game is loaded with gamebreaking bugs and glitches that can make it a frustrating experience. However if I was not frustrated I wouldn't care and this game is one of the best experiences I can have in steam. This game is not beginner friendly in the slightest but that just makes it so much more rewarding when you can finally escape the killer. The meta shifts greatly and currently I am not a fan of the whole pallet looping meta we got going on but that's okay. Constant new updates keep the game fresh as well as fix many issues with the game. Personally I liked daily rituals better when there was a big deal and you could get over 100 thousand bloodpoints but I guess it's okay. Overall this game is highly competitive and for good reason.

The night I purchased this I bought it along with four other friends and we played a few hours in a private group the issue came when one person left....We quickly realized that this game has no public match group support so you can solo q or well you can solo q. If you dont happen to have a full group of five people then you arn't even able to private q so basically you are unable to play with friends. More over not only can you not play with friends you can't even play with the community. Basically there are no redeeming social aspects to the game and for that I give it a huge thumbs down. I have read that the dev is \"working\" on making group play a real thing but before that they want to make sure people who drop out of games early are punished better. I don't understand why this game even has a ranking system or trys to promote any kind of e sports functions. If it was a lets try to survive a psycho killer with your friends that had all the fun and screams that I enjoyed with a full group of people then it would be a home run. Sadly Starbreeze Studios really dropped the ball on this one. I would check back in on this to see if they fix the social issue because it is super fun just not alone.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

BUT i've been having loads of fun playing this game it's competitive it's a bit scary although you always want more! It just makes you feel so awesome when you survive or when you actually outsmart the survivors and sacrifice all of them.

From the menu screen to the perk tree from the game to the afterwards eveything is downright atmospherically creepy. The \"uneasy\" horror feeling is very well captured. Whether you're screaming and running from the killer or desperately fixing a generator the game succeeds in bringing out that heart pounding exhilaration of Outlast or Penumbra.However after a few hours you can already see the writing on the walls. The game takes itself a bit too seriously it seems. IMO this game is best as a scary casual experience but like with most games a few select people want it to be more than that. You might be a little noob laughing your off and running around aimlessly with your friends... The killer has over 500 hours of experience has mastered their character of choice has memorized every map layout knows all spawn location patterns all generator points etc. The game's counter to this is a constant balancing tweaking reworking everything from perks to villains. This again in turn supports the feeling that the game is trying to be something its not... some kind of actual competitive skill based gameplay for the few who take it way too seriously rather than the masses who just want fun.I will return in future dates with my friends and update my review accordingly I just hope they make the game more casual terror filled fun as opposed to a competitive wipe the floor meta experience )","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

In some cases it is okay to play online however you'll find barely any team mates will help you. Other than that this is a really good horror game!With the addition of Survive with friends it has made the game greatly better you can have hours of fun with your friends with a new experience each time.Additionally some of the killers are annoying *cough* the Wraith *cough* and many killers will just camp you on the hooks like they are babysitting you but everyone has their own play styleSome killers are actually quite cheeky and will team up with you and help you repair generators if you help them kick down barricades\/ hit you a few times for points. GETTING INTO GAMESAs of patch 1.0.5 trying to get into games is absolutely horrible you could be sitting in a lobby getting 'no matches found' and then finding that the killer leaves because he is matched with high level players. KILLERS STOP BEING S.OPINIONSPersonally i get randomely taken off the game whilst normally playing due to unknown errors where a message is displayed asking why you were taken off the game which i suppose is good for the developers and their future enhancements.The ranking up system is slightly bad you have the skill tree level which is fantastic then the survivor\/killer rank where you have to win numerous games in a row to rank up an XP system of some sort would be prefered (opinion)Again the game is really fun when managing to get into a game and i play i have much fun playing it for hours on end","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Because of its popularity by now everybody should know what they're buying.It's abit like hide and seek but the killer is always it. You're trapped in an area and need to fix generators to restore power to the door. Open the door to escape sounds pretty simple right? You already know anyway?The replayability of this isn't amazing. I can come back to it occasionally but as you can see I don't have masses of hours on record. Thats because its the same thing over and over. I would still recommend it though especially if you have a group of people that own it. A major downfall for a Twitch streamer is they also VERY TEDIOUSLY don't allow you to rank up in Custom games. If they don't want it to affect ranked they need to at least a seperate system so you actually have a goal or get benefits from playing games. I grew tired very quickly because I play with friends\/viewers alot and no end game reward kills it. It's not even that hard to implement. Dev's if you're reading this just please.I'm not a ranked try hard. If I was I would probably say playing Ranked on a broken game would be way too stressful. I'm out on it completely. The glitches are REALLY f**king annoying and you can do really well but t**ts will just immediately leave when they get killed.I feel like the developers are working on this I recommend because of this.

I'll address the popular negative review points.**BUGS** I haven't encountered a lot of bugs just one. Sometimes when i'm trying to crouch and move I just stop moving. And I'm not sure if it's my computer's problem or the map's. I have played all 3 maps and it happened in all of them.**LOBBY ERRORS**I had wait times of less than a minute connecting as a survivor you do get the \"failed to join lobby\" error but you just have to re click the \"join lobby\" until you get one. Never took me more than 2 clicks. I feel like the issue is mostly not enough killers (killers make lobbys) and too many survivors. Reading the reviews made it sound a lot worse than it actually was and this is at best a slight annoyance like seriously REALLY minscule. **PARTY GAMES**Devs are working on it and by their developer updates it seems like it's coming along swimmingly. Honestly I don't have anyone else to even play with so this is not a deal breaker for me. **BETA VS FULL RELEASE**As I did not have access to the beta I cannot really comment on this The only issues I kinda have with this full realease I wish there were more maps survivors and killers. Hopefully more will be coming I haven't heard anything about that.Whew! Now that we got the main complaints out of the way. Let's talk...**GAMEPLAY**I actually had a lot of fun with this. The soundtrack is great and the mechanics are awesome. Fortunately I didn't deal with any window chessing people rage quiting and my rank managed to stay inttact. Playing as a survivor is actually wikcked fun and it's actually stressful. You can't attack but you can outsmart Just be aware of your surroundings As a killer you have awesome traps and abilities. **IN CONCLUSION**This game has great gameplay and if you're willing to do a few clicks to join a lobby then this game is for you. Definitely worth it hopefully it will improve with future patches.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

BUTThe Support is just horrible!!! There is a Bug known for almost a year called \"Lost Progress\".As the Name already calls it out there is a chance to loose your Progress like i did and now im waiting for more like 1 Month to get Points or anything in exchange but the Support just doesnt care.. Of course it's way more important to release new DLC's and SH** instead of helping the Players with their problem. Already sent 3 Mails wrote personally with a Mod but it changed nothing. edit Got an answer like 1 5 months after the problem occured. I got Bloodpoints in exchange (not enough for the time i played) and my \"legacy\" skin is gone too. ______________________________________________________________If you wanna play Killer go ahead and buy the Game. But if you want to play Survivor don't even think about it. With each Patch the Developers somehow nerf the Survivors and buff the Killers (With Perks and other Changes) so as a Survivor Main i can't enjoy this Game anymore.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

IF the monster is camping that is 3 gens for FREE! You would be hurting yourself more to Camp as a killer then for the other 4. It is very well balanced BUT the people Make the very good things sound like they are the worst thing in the world. Like body blocking or being a meat shield. They are kinda needed with some of the killers as many can 1 hit you. Also some can be Toxic calling you hacker cheater camper so on and so on. How ever I do NOT wanna scare you away with buying the game. For $30 it was a very nice game. Being lev 0 and being trash. The getting lev 5 10 and we get better and learn the maps. And lev 15 25 you are much better and gettign a good idea of the game. And if your with the max ranks they will 90% of the time have the better perks and save you more. So in english. If your a killer (you get hate) If your a medic you get all the (love) in the world. For newplayers Try to youtube or google a few tips if you need them. Last on the list...HAVE FUN!

Now it seems the developers are making this game worse as they keep updating and updating. That's some stuff you can really overlook however what makes this game bad is the community. People complain about killers that need a buff and survivors need debuff which the developers get sensitive about and just go along whatever the community wants them to do. Another thing are the campers\/ area camping. There are killers that camp near you to prevent you from escaping regardless if other survivors are trying to rescue you. This has been going on since the beginning when the game was released and the developers refuse to do something about it cause they dont see it as a \"big deal\". Hopefully they deal with the campers and tje unbalanced killers as well such as myers and the doctor.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

If not your game may die from F13 (it unlikely but it's always possible).Or another thing pallet looping or sitting at pallets. Bloodlust helps a chase end quicker but they can fall into a pallet looper's tricks even easier now and get stunned over and over and OVER! I have an idea to stop this or at least make it harder for those who sit around make it so only a pallet can be dropped while running.There are many other things I could complain about but i would be sitting here for hours.Please BHVR step up your game with this.

It has a ton of potential and really hits a niche really well. It falls short in the execution however. Things I wish I'd known before I purchased Skill Tree. Sounds REALLY fun BUT (there are so many \"buts\" when describing good parts of this game) you can only earn bloodpoints (which you spend on skills) in public matches. However you can't queue for public matches with your friends. So your options are 1) Be able to take advantage of the skill tree and improve your character 2) Play with your friends. Not both. Honestly I wish I would have known that when I purchased because I would have waited for it to be added.Load times. Holy hell. After you wait about 5 minutes to finally put together a group due to people constantly jumping in and out of lobbies (if you and a friend both enter a quick play game at the same time you have a chance of both being entered into the same lobby so people are CONSTANTLY trying to do this) you hit the loading screen for a good 2 minutes before the game finally starts.Balancing....or lack there of. Let me tell you how a typical game goes as a survivor. Killer will eventually find you he grabs you puts you on a hook killer camps your body. One of two things happens now. 1) You die because no one saves you. 2) Someone saves you but the killer immediately hits you and you puts you right back on the hook and then you die immediately. Neat.Between the glitches the horrible mechanics around punishing (or not punishing) for DCs (this has been mostly addressed it seems but should have been done and perfected during beta) and the skill tree nonsense I outlined above (how hard would it be to have a ranked and unranked skill tree?) I can't recommend this. These are the problems I'd expect from a beta or an early access game not a full release.All that being said I do think this game can be good given the amount of effort they appear to be giving after release so assuming the updates keep coming and we either get a way to have an unranked skill tree or the ability to queue for ranked games with friends I'll update this review.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I don't have an issue with any of them really. What I do have an issue with is bloodlust III. It is an inevitable down. Doctors add ons give him far too much reach which is why players dc the second they see he is the killer.Other Fixes pallet drops on killers holding victims... the killers aren't dropping victims when they are flashlighted AND blinded or when a pallet is dropped on them. This is a major bug. Also 99% sabotaging hooks and then having to start them all over again... this has killed me several times in my mose recent games. It seems to be a bug. Also unhooking from all directions needs to be fixed so it actually works.... or even just take it out I ve noticed it encourages camping even more than the encouragement it had before. Also the NEW POINTS SYSTEM... No One likes the 2 hooks for everyone and one kill or 2 kills for pip system... we'd rather have to get x amount of points.Aesthetic things If it looks like I can fit through the space between a damn tree and a rock I should be able to run in the space between the tree and rock or whatever the hell I m trying to fit in between. This has caused many deaths and not all of them are my own. DUDE I VE A SEEN A SET OF TIRES SPAWN IN FRONT OF A CHEST!!!!!! That means ithe chest can't be opened! &lt Fix thisAlso face camping is very encouraged as of late... which is anooying when the new hooks aren't working.And not enforcing the rules by banning or suspending players or deducting blood points or anything of the sort that may be used as punishment for cheating or unsportsmanlike playing is building a pretty toxic community. Where in end game chat we read things like \"blah blah blah\" \"u salty idiot\" \"moron\" and then the person talking to you dc's before you have a chance to ask if something like if the game was bugged or if they were cheating because a totem they didn't play just happened to be in the game. DBD really needs to start enforcing rules and looking into\/at reports and gameplay to see which players should be banned\/punished even if for a short period of time. This will make gameplay more enjoyable especially for players who see a lot more potential growth for the game if the rules were to become enforced.P.S. I do recommend this game to others.

For the time I have played I loved this game as a challenging and competetive game. The base of the gameplay is that you can choose to play either Killer or Survivor. If you select Killer you host a match. There is one Killer in a round and 4 survivors your objective as a killer is to kill or sacrifice the remaining survivors to please the entity (A mysterious spider like being) If you select survivor you are placed in a lobby created by the killer. The objective as the survivor is to communicate with other team mates to survive. To escape the wretched entity's trial you must fix 5 generators to do so it takes about 2 3 minutes to fix one gennerator. While fixing a generator a minigame called \"skillchecks\" randomly apear if you hit the skillcheck in the white or outlined area you pass the skillcheck with no problem if you hit it in the white area you get a little boost in repairing however if you miss the skill check by hitting it too early or too late it notifies the killer visually and gives away your possition. Once you repaired all the generators you have to open an exit gate. The exit gates are revealed to all survivors for a prior amount of time however the killer can see it for ever. to open the gates there is a lever you must take about 15 30 seconds holding the lever down to open the gate. Once opened you are able to escape. That was the base point of the game as a survivor the killer must hit you 2 times to be able to put you on a hook. The killer is able to grab you from generators or other obstacles to automaticaly be able to hook you. Team mates are able to heal you and unhook you. One of the best ways of escaping the killer is to hide or use Pallets flashlights or faking out to slug the killer. As the killer you have a \"Power\" using this \"Power\" allows you to catch the survivors easily. I love that every killer has a unique power.One thing that i wouldn't like for them to continue is that they keep adding popular Horror movie killers. Don't get me wrong it is amazing and fun to play them but i would like a bit of originality like the huntress or hag. But over all I extremely suggest this game. The developers try their hardest to please the community and fix many game breaking glitches.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Though if you're goint into it to be scared I think you'll be disapointed. Each killer has a unique and interesting ability to shake up gameplay. However with each new patch new bugs are introduced which can take you out of the experience very quickly. On top of that the fanbase can be very toxic on both sides which can often detract from the experience both in the game and on the forums. For example Many people complain about Killers not being strong enough so when the devs try to buff them people move on to freaking out about the buff making the game unplayable.The game isn't going to be for everyone but despite its myriad of problems I wholeheartedly recommend it.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

A review Comparing DbD to Friday the 13th The Game. (Since these two fanbases butt heads a lot and draw comparisons constantly)It's a solid experience but Dead by Daylight just isn't scary to me. It feels too much like a video game and not enough like a horror movie. If that makes sense?Like I played DbD and found it to be tense but less in the fun way more in the game y way. I don't like how you have to hang people on hooks and a big monster comes from the sky. That all seems less scary and more silly to me. I don't enjoy that it feels like a game show with an arena and clear exits that need power to open. I don't like the consumable items that carry between rounds. That also detracts from immersion for me. I wanna feel like I'm seriously being hunted. Friday the 13th The Game even in Beta accomplished that for me.So for the kind of game I want F13 just fits better. It's my style. I like slower more methodical games and DbD is far from that in my experience. I love how many different kills there are and how visceral it feels and I adore the lighting in the game too. It just feels right to me.So in my opinion even though the beta was totally buggy the core mechanics are so strong that it remained fun to play despite it's glitchiness. That instills a lot of confidence in me as a customer.I just feel acutely aware that I'm playing a video game with DbD. I don't want to feel that way. I need to get pulled into the world. However all that said DbD is still a solid game and worth taking a look. I wouldn't say it's bad. That's why I still recommend it. Overall while not my speed I don't think it's a bad game. I can see what people love about it. It's just those same things they love I am not so keen on. But that doesn't make this a bad product. Give it a try! See for yourself if you enjoy this approach to Asymetrical MP horror.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The game mechanics still need to be edited to where killers and survivors are on an equal playing field when all survivors are working togehter. I am not high ranking but I have noticed that most killers abuse their abiltites and some even use other glitchy methods to their advantage. I enjoy the concept and love the games design but further editing to the killers functions needs to be a neccessity and survivor teamwork needs to be buffed. My recomendation would be to add in a stamina meter for both the surviors and killers. This would mean that vaulting and putting down barricades wears down your stamina than just sincerely running away from the killer. The killer holding onto survivors will slow down when holding onto to them and will have to plan out attacks as stamina recovery for killers for each kill goes down each time. I feel if these last few changes are added in the game will be at its completion and I do believe revisory of certain perks are needed on both sides so that way \"everyone\" can be on a equal playing field.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

That's just a bonus. (Fun fact Play the hag if you REALLY want to off the survivors.) The perk system feels rewarding as each perk can provide a large advantage to it's user survivor and killer alike.

You start out with absolutely nothing and you'll end up paired with an experienced player with several perks and offerings. There isn't any form of balanced matchmaking because the developers don't seem to understand balance. On multiple occasions you will run into a killer who camps the hooks for XP making who ever comes near his next victum. If you aren't lucky your teammates will be trash and not attemt to help others but rather run around the map doing their own thing.

{"date_posted":"2017-10-07","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":35,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Not Recommended","review":"Hide and seek... I mean Dead by Daylight is horror survival attempt that matches 4 players (survivors) against one (the killer). The players have a few cosmetic options and they can start the match with a selection of perks an item (if they are survivors) and loadouts for that said item (or their special ability in the killer's case) and each player can burn 1 offering that can alter the map give them point boosts at the end or some advantages during the match. Survivors have to repair 5 generators and then they can open one of the 2 exit gates (or both) and escape while the killer has to put them down and hook them in order to sacrifice them to the Entity.The outcome of the game is decided like this 1) If the killer has the execution offering he has 100% chance of winning. Only the last survivor standing can escape using the hatch (a secret exit which appears when the first 2 generators are repaired and opens when there's only one survivor left alive) and that still counts as a win for the killer.2) 60% map layout. If generators are close to each other the killer wins. If they are out in the open the killer wins. If not survivors have a good chance of escaping. And if the map has a decent amount of pallets walls windows and cornfields and the generators are not close to each other then it becomes rather easy to escape without even being spotted by the killer.3) 30% perks loadouts and offerings (besides the execution one). There are killer perks that greatly decrease the killer's terror radius (a survivor's strongest help in being aware of the killer's presence) perks that greatly increase the killer's FOV essentially making killers incredibly harder to escape and to hide from. Survivors have some handy perks such as self healing sabotaging without toolboxes walking twice as fast while crouching and short movement burst which really don't help much if the killer is decent enough to read your scratch marks which leads to &gt 4) 10% player skill the killer's skill in particular. There are some jukes you can perform to confuse the killer and escape from his LOS unless he has one of the 2 perks that increase your FOV if he has the frequent bleeding perk on a lit map... or if he doesn't play with his volume turned off and he actually listens to the sound FX.A good killer who's paying attention will NEVER fail to catch a survivor this is how this game is designed. A survivor running around leaves so many traces the scratch marks being the most over powered innate perk that every killer has. If you don't run away you will be caught very quickly and if you do you will still be caught in part due to the trail that tells the killer exactly where you went but hey you'll buy some time at least. The trail is really messy and easy to spot by the killer. It can be used to a survivor's advantage on a dumber killer and it will even work on a skilled one if you do the trick while out of his line of sight but if you've already been hit by the killer once it's over. Your character's regular moans will destroy your chances of escaping and all you can hope for is that the killer is deaf. Considering how the first hit is free most of the time a killer starts chasing you thanks to this game's limited means for a slow survivor to get away from a speedy killer you can guess the outcome of most chases in this game.Playing against a low level killer is a fun experience I don't find anything more rewarding in this game than escaping from a killer especially when you have no idea how he passed by without noticing you. But against any decent killer it comes down to hiding as well as you can and rescuing survivors and being rescued unless... you know... (1)Playing as a killer is simple. You can win without using any special abilities unless the map favors the survivors. Perks are not much of a factor except for the 2 types mentioned above which make the game excessively one sided as they negate\/ any advantages a survivor has over the killer (the FOV and the ability to sense when a killer is near). The map can often obstruct a killer's sight but it can also obstruct a survivor's movement making the game more of a hide and seek. Skyping with your friends as a survivor while matching together can make things A LOT easier and while not that common in lower rank play it turns things entirely on the survivors' side giving the killer a game breaking experience. If you hook a survivor and camp him\/her you will end up with at least 3 generators done if you don't camp the survivors he's absolutely going to be freed in no time.To conclude things I find DBD to be an unbalanced game. While this can spice things up at first it quickly becomes a nuisance.I'd only recommend this game if you have a group of friends to play with as a team or if you like to play as a killer out of a horror movie. I might be a bit harsh because this game failed to deliver what I expected from it. In a few words I can describe Dead by Daylight as acomplex hide and seek","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Dead by Daylight has been an awesome experience that I'm still enjoying and will continue enjoying for months to come. First off here is what bothers me (and almost everyone else too) The connection when getting chased by the killer will almost garuntee that if you hop through a wall and the killer swings at you youre probably going to take a hit even though you're well past the wall. This is aparently because the game is hosted by the killer when you're in the lobby. So you as the survivor you need to take that knowledge onto the field and attempt to escape another way if you think that youre going to get screwed going through a window. WITH THAT BEING SAID. I love this game. Almost every game I enter my heart starts beating and the adrenaline rush hits me. You probably wont be good at this game for a day or two until you grasp some of the main functions of escaping the killers grasp. Like hiding breaking the running marks enough to confuse the killer using your perks the correct way and applying team work when you cannot communicate with the other survivors.The maps have some of the same looks but theyre all each procedurally generated so nothing is usually exactly the same. This witholds both the killer and the survivors the \"home field advantage.\" However if you play the game enough youll begin to learn how to out manouver the killer so that youll have just enough time to make a quick getaway. Each killer has their own special ability so you'll get to learn how they each function and how to best beat them. The same thing goes for the survivors. Everyone has their own thing that will help out their teamates and make it about teamwork. All in all I'd give this game an 8 out of 10. Try it out with a friend. It's a lot better than playing solo.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

You can choose several killers (like Mike Myers or a crazy hillbilly with a chainsaw) and several survivals depending on your preference. The leveling system is easy. You get bloodpoints for winning or loosing but of course more for winning. You spend them on perks skills offerings and some items that you use in game. At the same time the more bloodpoints you spend the higher level you get 50 is max level. The more games you win the lower rank you get starting at 20 (lowest) and max is numero uno (highest).Play solo or with friends. I d say that its a bit more fun to play with friends but unfortunatly i dont have that many friends playing this game so its more solo for me still very funny.Now to the sad part the game is buggy. It gets better all the time with patches but still buggy. I cant play survival without playing a killer game first! and i cant play two games in a row as a survival. As a killer there is no problem so i mostly play killer. Its a bit sad because it would be fun to mix more between killer and survival.If you can endure these bugs this game is a diamond in the rough. As i said earlier the game gets better with each patch. Enough? I dont know only you can decide that.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I started out as the Wraith (Dude with bell that goes invisible) and Hag (Green small female killer long arms) only to find out that I have most fun with the trapper (Bear trap killer)FRIENDLY \/ SALTY INGAME COMMUNITY? The community is pretty much as salty in the game itself as people complain about on the forums. I often see killers and both survivors \"gg\" \"nice teamwork \"nice chase\" after a completed game. But the overflow of \"ez game\" \"trash killer \" \"camping TFUZGUZ\" \" )&amp (? Killer\" on the survivor's side massively overshadows all of that.People tend to complain about camping killers or looping survivors. Survivors can be cocky at times. Like all 4 survivors sitting in front of the exit gate until they see the killer approach and then escape together. Just to let the killer see how they all escape into his face. Then after the match write \"Easy\".Even tho I am a Survivor Main I would say that its the survivors that try to abuse the game more often when at the same time getting really salty on the killers. These things started happening to me when I got past rank 15. So a little bit later in the game like 30hours gameplay.NOTE the devs say camping is a valid strategy surivors should do gens when the killer wants to stay at the hook forever. after all it takes 3 minutes to get a survivor from 1st stage to entity summoned. STEAM COMMUNITYI like to send out friend requests to killers\/survivors whose gameplay i like have a chitchat on steam and then play together for a while. People really appreciate friend requests as noone wants to play alone on survivor after all. In case that the team and killer are more or less equally skilled it comes down to the map offerings (more fog less fog spawn close to each other which the players use before they spawn into the map.Offernigs do help like they are supposed to however they totally dont win the game by default. BALANCE?The gameplay feels balanced a good killer will own an averge team a good team will own an average killer. Some maps however are quite disadvantageous for killers i m referrring to the Kornfield Maps. However one map is really bad for survivors being The Game. BEING SURVIVOROverall the game feels tense and scary\/panicy when the killer owns but controlled\/collected when the team owns on survivor mode. Monolog on survivor is sth like this\" f f f f f f f ff f ! ! ! \" \"where is he where is he where is he??????\" ORhe hehe he he second generator doooOOOne biaches! Ok LETS DO THIS!BEING THE KILLERwhereas the killer s gameplay feels fun and exciting when winning or frustrating when failing.HOWEVER! I personally only feel frustrated on killer when i didnt hook a single player. Killing one or more for me is already like a win and the game gives you as killer the most points overall just for chasing injuring and hooking (without en doing the actual kill). Being a killer that doesnt really camp a lot survivors often compliment the match with a \"gg\" \"nice killer gameplay nice chase\" which lightens up my mood even if the scoreboard doesnt.YOUTUBEI watched about 40hours of gameplay on youtube before i decided to purchase the game having seen most of the content before playing it myself didnt take any of the fun away in my opinion.You might think that you always do the same stuff and you basically do. Its your job to do generatos get to exit escape. however there is so much happening inbetween that it does not feel the same. The haste of the match is decided by the kind of killer you encounter the teammates and the map. DLCs Next to that we got many DLCs which are not exactly cheap but 100% not required to play the game. You can access dlc maps without having it purchased you also fight the dlc killers and survivors. the dlc only restricts you into not being able to play the dlc killer\/survivor yourself. You can even get the DLC content specific skills\/perks by the shrine which resets every 7 days.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

While in the first week or two when it was the 3 killers and 4 survivors to choose from I played this game for hours upon hours now I can't play it for more than a single match or two. In its current form it's grown far too much for its own good and this is a classic case of \"Less is more.\" With each new killer\/character they release comes new perks that can be learned through the Bloodweb which sounds great in theory being that new content is usually a welcome thing in the gaming universe. In my personal opinion all this does is break the balance that game was capable of in the early stages add convoluted new systems and even more potential for perk abuse. Which leads to my next point.The community of this game is the most toxic community I've ever seen next to League of Legends. It's a constant \"Us vs Them\" mentality between Killer mains and Survivor mains where both sides do nothing but cry and complain about broken perks abuse of abilities and how easy the other side has it. As someone who has played both killer and survivor my personal opinion is thus. With respawning hooks to negate sabotage more hooks on the map ability to kick generators being added killers have such a distinct advantage that it's actually boring to play as killer because winning every game only stays fun for so long... and as survivor unless you're playing against a killer who has literally never played before it's going to be fairly uncommon to actually win in the conventional way.TLDR Unbalanced gameplay toxic community too much content to allow for balance and a fanbase too divided to ever allow a happy medium. Pass on this get yourself something better...","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

There are plenty of killers to pick from multiple survivors with their own unique perks and a plethora of levels with varied design to entertain yourself with. That being said the community is quite hit or miss and the game itself can be buggy at times. The lobby is one of my major complaints about this game. Half the time it'll join a game only to kick me out and make me re search for another lobby. This is only one of the many problems I've had with this game. Surviving with friends is damn near impossible to get into a lobby for some random reason. (See Edit below)But those issues aside the gameplay is solid and it's good for short bursts or long sessions. It can be something you can lose yourself in.Overall I'd say try it out for the price. Play a game or two to see if you like it. If not refunding is always an option.Edit The lobby issues have since been fixed (including Survive with Friends) since this review and the bugs are less prevalent.

Check the bottom for the updated parts. If you read through the negative reviews for Dead by Daylight you'll generally find two things genuine complaints about the bugs and people who simply aren't good at the game talking about how this Killer or that Survivor perk is \"broken\" or \"nerfed.\"Let's be real for a moment Lots and I mean lots of people are just bad at this game. You'll see them trust me. They either can't learn to work as a part of a team (or can't find others who try which is only a real problem at the lower ranks with all the other newbies) or they don't have the stuff to take down a team on their own. So to start don't pay attention to these particular complaints. They are made by people who as the kids say suck at either specific aspects of the game or the game as a whole.CONS Now on to credible cons. The bugs too often render the game unplayable. I'm looking at you loading screen bug. If you're like me and used to playing buggy games this will be tolerable for you I mean having to exit the game several times and reboot it is by no means an issue to people who make a habit of playing games in their alphas we're almost surprised when we *don't* ever have to relaunch a game. If you don't like the waiting you may struggle with this and that would be a valid reason to avoid Dead by Daylight. Until such a time as the developers finally fix this issue (among others of course) I expect and encourage a lot of complaining about the loading screen bug.Sometimes you'll get put in a lobby with someone either way above or way below your rank. It happens. You'll get butchered by a rank 4 Killer (who isn't really enjoying it either mind you you're too easy) and you'll make a far too easy getaway from a rank 19 Killer who hasn't yet learned how to look in the bushes. This is frustrating for everyone in the lobby and you'll probably catch some flak for it if you were the one misplaced the Survivors in particular (usually ranks 15 10 the ones who have gotten good at the game and are still in their angsty phase of play where they think everyone else sucks and should be told so) can be a salty bunch.More often than you'll probably like you'll get put in a lobby with an Old McDonald's WiFi Killer and you'll lag badly enough that you'll either die because of it or be disconnected entirely. Yeah it's frustrating but that happens in any multiplayer game hosted by one of the players. Somehow people seem to attribute this flaw to Dead by Daylight in particular which is absurd. That being said dedicated servers should they ever become available for the game would be fantastic and that's the half of this complaint that is completely valid.PROS Now that we've addressed the major cons of the game let's look at some of the pros. The way the leveling system works at its core is that you gain points and ranks based on how many points you scored in a match. There's four ways for Survivors and four ways for Killers to get these points. That on its own is a fairly basic and simple system. The part of this system that makes the game great is *what* those ways to get points are. For example as a Survivor you gain points towards leveling by assisting saving or even just being near your fellow Survivors. You make progress in the game by helping each other a seamlessly introduced method of encouraging players to stick together. As a Killer you get points from using your chosen Killer's special power (chainsaw short range teleporting etc.) meaning that you're inherently going to level up as certain Killers better than others you do in fact make a special kind of progress by playing to your strengths. Speaking of leveling while your rank is static across all the different Survivors and all the different Killers each specific member of each group is counted and leveled individually. This means that most of the time a Jake Park player is a Jake Park player that's who you're good at that's who you play. It leaves room for diversity among players because it's not as simple as \"this one does more damage so naturally everyone plays him.\" There's no one Survivor or Killer that's better than the next they're all unique in some way and they all play to different types of players' styles and tastes.Finally as a horror game enthusiast when I initially played Dead by Daylight I found that the fear that accompanies hiding from a monster that isn't an AI that is in fact another person was far more satisfying than waiting for the programmed beastie to finish its programmed patrol and move on when I knew it was safe. You can't predict a Killer as easily as that because it's not nearly as easy to know what they're doing. Are they really gone or did they take a few steps away to wait for you to come out? Is he revving up that chainsaw because he actually did see you or is he just trying to scare you out of hiding? Do you stay or do you go? As I played on of course this fear eventually left me. But it didn't fade away it transformed into strategy. I'm not playing a game trying to figure out the patterns of the AI monster I'm trying to either outsmart and outrun or outsmart and run down another person. This dynamic may not be as prevelant at the lower ranks which is natural given that at lower ranks players simply aren't as experienced but should you stick to the game long enough you'll find a unique kind of game that you're going to love just as much at rank 1 as you did at rank 20 if you're anything like me. tl dr If you can't handle bugs waiting and lag this game probably isn't for you. If you're prone to outrage when someone's better at a game than you this game probably isn't for you. If you can appreciate strategy skill and teamwork this game is for you. 8\/10 do recommend.UPDATE Dead by Daylight is an ever growing ever changing game. And it's changed a lot since I started playing and since I wrote this review. Lots of new killers and survivors new maps new perks updates to the way things used to work... I won't get into specifics but one thing you can definitely count on is that this game is not a stagnant one. It's still evolving and it's still improving. The community however has overall gotten much saltier since last writing. That's something that can't really be helped by the developers or by other players it just is. All of this being said I've found that the longer one plays Dead by Daylight the *more* hooked one becomes. It's not a game where playing for the first 100 hours is the highlight and it fades from attention after that. In fact you don't even really begin to understand the game until you're much further in. At 171 hours I know enough to stay alive and kill people a lot more efficiently than I used to but I'm still a rookie compared to some of the people that play this game with 500 1 000 3 000 hours logged. If you're looking for a game that'll stick with you as long as you stick with it this is the place to be.Score remains at 8\/10.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2016-06-25","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":5,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"So after watching some guys on YouTube play this game and looking like they were having a total blast I decided I could risk the seventeen dollar price. So I'll do a pros and cons thing first and then tell my experiences as survivors and killers.Pros Fantastic premise for a game. Four almost defenseless survivors against one bloodthirsty killer. Love it! It's been quite some time that a game has gotten me this immersed. Like when I'm mere seconds from completeing a goal as a survivor and the killer is coming at me at full speed makes me heart pound. Getting to slaughter a group of young adults in a brutal fashion is a blast.Cons Rampant Disconnection. My very first game had the killer disconnect and shut down the match because us survivors were already opening the exits and he hadn't even injured a single one of us. This has happened about a total of three times out of about ten games. I've noticed a few surivors on my team as well disconnect the moment they realize that we couldn't save them. Only about two times for this. From the forums this looks to be a massive loophole that helps save a players useable items and rank. Devs said they have fixed this. It's not scary. It gets my heart beating from some close calls but I've never been scared. I'd blame this on the 3rd person view survivors always have. Now I almost want to give this a pass since this is first and foremost a multiplayer game survivors need to have 3rd person to survive. The maps are kinda randomly made but not enough to notice any difference. AKA not something that should be advertised as a feature.P.S. These are just issues I have noticed. As a killer I never had a survivor make use of a multiple windows to avoid me forever something a lot of people have brought up. Same goes for Killer perks being useless and survivors being OP.Now onto my little tales.As a survivor I've had multiple close calls. Like I mentioned above opening the gate to escape with only two seconds left until it opens and having the killer be in full site coming at me full speed. These moments are awesome. As are the times you are running for your life with the killer right behind you. Or even hiding in a cabinet as the killer wanders by hoping he doesn't decide to search for you. The only survivor I've played as is Dwight.As for Killers I've done Trapper and Hillbilly. As Trapper it is so fun to lay a perfectly hidden trap and then watch a survivor get caught as they try to save their team. Hillbilly... well I sucked as him. Big time. All four survivors got away and I only hooked one and didn't land a single chainsaw attack. Overall you feel super powerful knowing that the survivors can do barely anything to stop you. TL DR From my experience this game has been a blast. It's intense as a survivor and brutally fun as a killer. For me the sheer amount of fun I've gotten from my short experience is enough to make me feel safe in my purchase.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Survive with friends is here but takes forever to queue it's like they didn't even do any user studies to validate that their queue system is useable. Get used to seeing \"No match found\" and constantly clicking your mouse unable to multitask and in the off chance you do find a lobby if you're &lt rank 10.Say you get into lobby you have to spam to see your latency to the host or else you'll end up glitching and teleporting around the map because you have poor connection to the host and you're better off just AFKing and going to YouTube looking for something to watch while you find another game.You'll get matched with people in China and your latency will be above 500ms making the game unplayable. The developers have said they won't add a ping number in the lobby which is not a proper way to address your players.It's a fun game at it's core but riddled with a miserable queue system will leave you frustrated.TLDR Game should be in beta still until they figure out how to properly implement a queue latency check and hiding rank.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Aside from the large number of glitches terrible netcode and broken matchmaking there isn't any replayability. Every match is identical from the maps themselves and especially at lower levels the killer strategy is the same every time put someone on a hook and sit there. It's a guaranteed win for the survivors if they ignore them which they never do if they're PUGs because there is no way to communicate but it makes the game boring for both sides regardless of what happens. The maps are barely distinguishable and your survival hinges solely on if you're lucky enough to be near an abusable infinite use window hopping back and forth because the killer so vastly outspeeds you and kills you in at most two hits. This might change at higher levels with perks but there is no incentive to put in the hundreds of hours to get to this point so its largely irrelevant.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Every game start 5 generators and pull a lever. That is it. There is no point in trying to evade the killer as hacking is rife in this game and the devs refuse to do anything about it. In fact apart from making new events this game is now pretty much abandonware. Also software issues and design flaws these happen a lot. One of the most amusing is when half the team crashes. All that nice shiny rare loot you took into the game? Prepare to lose it because only 2 survivors made it into the game (if you die you lose anything you take in) and there is no way you are going to defeat the killer with half a team.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I'd once again like to commend the developers for being total . Instead of working on matchingmaking services like any sane game designer would do they decided it was more important to release another killer and provide useless scaling patches in order to undo the damages that they did with the previous ones. Only in Dead by would a person decide that having your users play a ready up simulator for 45 minutes prior to getting a game with friends is a praise worthy event. Part 3 Re updating my review again. I'd like to add that after multiple updates the match making system is worse than ever. Not only is it nearly impossible to get into a match but when you do you get put against the who have been playing this game since its conception. If sitting around for 30 minutes without a game trying to queue with your friends prior to getting skull ed is for you buy this game.Part 2 Improving my review from to mediocre. The group matchmaking now actually works in the sense that if you wish to be placed against people that consistantly butt you without any type of lube.

Survivors keep getting nerfed and killers keep getting more and more bonuses. New Killer shows that developers encourage camping. While this was frustrating before it could be worked around by grabbing generators while the killer was distracted. Newest killer however has the ability to set traps that grant vision and teleportation to any 10 areas on the map. This gives her the ability to camp multiple locations at the same time. The downside to this omnipresence? N\/A.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I'm a survivor main but recently I've started to lose more and more games and I've tried to play killer for fun (and to try to understand why I'm doing this bad right now). Reason is simple game is easier for killers by far. I use the Huntress with only 1 perk (and a bad one) against a premade team of a rank 4 rank 6 rank 7 and rank 17 survivor as a rank 17 Huntress. They all have perks yet I still managed to sacrifice all 4 of them rather easily. No perk practically no experience as a killer vs a team of organised and kindof experienced survivors with good perks and yet I still destroy them happened more than once. Now imagine if I was not colorblind and could actually see and follow the trail survivors leave behind them while running had experience as a killer and ran some op perks like whispers... I agree with the people that claim survivors are 4 vs 1 and should have a hard time escaping but now this is ridicoulous as a survivor there is almost no way to escape the killer because there is less pallets than before killer breaks them faster and killer vaults through windows too fast for me to lose him. If I go fast he just follows the trail I leave behind me. If I go slow I don't have enought distance to break the line of sight. Winrate as a survivor is less than 50% and winrate as a killer is more than 70% (3 or more sacrifices).TLDR Would I reccomend the game absolutely even with the lack of balancing there is still plenty of room for fun ESPECIALLY with friends and the game is totally worth his pricePS sorry english isn't my first language my grammar and\/or orthograph may be very bad","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The thrill of almost getting caught by the killer but managing to slip away or the thrill of the chase as the killer. Either way loads of fun.And the developers are awesome! The put out a weekly podcast to let the players know what they are working on next. They are always looking for ways to improve the game and have a real passion for making this game great. They also have great beards.There are some players that take the game too seriously if things don't go their way but that's EVERY online multiplayer game.

I recommend a new player to play as a survivor first and follow someone around when you find them or watch a few youtubers play it the game has some things your gonna wanna know about before you get into it. Its a decent horror game and I recommend it to anyone looking for a horror game. Its scared me good too many times. But i recommend it. Its good.

However going on two months of the game release things are \"still\" broken... Before \"steam\" took over the PC gaming world a game developer would have to release a finished product on CD. This game was released months before it should have been. Instead of \"balancing perks\" fix the real issues connectivity P2P hosting etc... The excuse \"it takes time\" to fix those issues doesn't cut it. If it takes that much time to fix those BIG issues then the \"official\" game should have been released later down the road. If you wanted the game to be released to the general public instead of a limited number of players then the game should be classified as \"early access\" which it is not. Screw the \"balancing perks\" update fix the real issues. Listen to the real complaints of bug and structure issues not some whiney people because they don't have tactful skills. You tell your players to \"get good\" well as a consumer to your product I say \"release a good update.\" If you have fixed a bug or a couple right away release that patch... Don't wait for almost two weeks to release that patch release it right away. I would rather have my game update everyday then wait two weeks for a bug to finally be fixed.

Continual window hopping survivors. Now to be fair they have tried to address this issue but it's still an issue every map has at least 1 spot that survivors can run around in an infinite circles and it becomes a game of who's going to mess up first. Only problem is you wil get survivors who will not mess up and now you have to give up and go check generators or if all generators are done you have to wait for them to make a run for the exit. Which could be in 10 minutes or 30 minutes how ever long they feel like or until they mess up. 2. TERRIBLE MATCHMAKING. As a survivor or killer I was constantly matched against killers\/survivors who were 20 30 even as high as 40 levels higher then me. Now for those of you who don't own this game what this means is im running around against a killer or multiple survivors who have high level perks which will buff them and assist them in some wayand they have multiple of these perks dues to their high level while you have 1 perk available and its a low level common perk. So let paint the picture for you your the killer level 10 rank 20 you get matched against 4 survivors level 30 35 32 45 you have 1 perk you can use say sloppy butcher ( makes them bleed more when you hit them) they all have 4 perks at their disposal lets say one has Saboteur (can disable your hooks and destory traps) and some other ultra rare perks to your common perk. You start the match finally knock down survivors to find there's no hooks nearby (due to saboteur) to hang them on and the nearest one is so far away that they can wiggle free from your grasp before you get there. Annoying huh? especially when all this could be avoided by matching you against players of a similar skill instead of throwing you in a blender against the best of the best as a new player.Now some things to mention these problems could change and some of these problems could be addressed in the future but I would avoid this game until then. Now some people may be fine with grinding and being used as a punching bag to higher rank players until they can level up and rank up themselves but im not if your fine with it then you may not mind this game.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It's not fun when the killer can SEE YOU when you spawn. You get a poor score and no currency to spend on levelling up. Since there is ALWAYS a basement somewhere on the map with 4 hooks and a chest surely the killer should always spawn there so the killer can't see the survivers at the moment of spawn?2) Matchmaking can have you with a level 1 surviver no perks or very very basic perks against a killer with a full load out of pink\/purple top tiers perks. Again... why bother trying at this point. Surely you should be matched with killers and survivers that match your level with the character you're playing so the experience is fair?Other than that this is a really really fun game but most of the fun is had with friends in a 5 man because of the above reasons online can sometimes leave you feeling a bit... let down by the unbalanced nature of things.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Lobby Simulator 2k17 but I have a new one.....Never Ending Chase Simulator 2k17.You get to be a killer but you do not really kill anyone you put them on hooks and the other players just take them right back off......just an annoying experience of exploits. Since I purchased it on a 50% off sale I got a few fun matches but once all the new players left I soon found out why the wait times are ridiculous.....bc no one wants to be a killer so you have huge quenes of survivors and no killers. To make things worse the only way to be effective in killing anyone you have to tightly patrol the hooks you put people on which they have to stay on for a certain amount of time to die........which will get you hazed in the after game chat. Other than the visuals and a few good matches the only thing this experience was good for was seeing what other games people recommend instead of this heaping pile of elephant dung. Which is terrible since they would most likely sell a lot of DLC if it didn't suck. All in all meh spent $12 got $5 worth of game so I can feel good knowing I only lost $7.oh forgot the non esistant Match Maker so you will get paired against people who have hundreds of hours of gameplay and unlocks which I can't fathom why they hate themselves enough for that level of self punishment. Honestly the game would be 1000% better with an offline mode or PVE mode with bots that don't cheat. I mean it will have to be a PVE at some point bc no one wants to be a killer and for good reason. If it were done right this game would be epicly entertaining but it's utter rubbish!","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It has its flaws (Major flaws are the loss of progress and other ingame gameplay related bugs). The killers are way too strong in my opinion. It might be different once the bugs that are in the game for months now would be fixed. Otherwise its a solid game. I recommed getting it if you are a fan of asymmetrical survival games. Get it now or the best option would be to wait until its on sale.Edit One last thing I have against the game is that it is using peer to peer connection. Its the 21st century... there is no reason not to get dedicated servers. These constant lag switches and laggy lobbies (I check my ping every lobby doesnt mean the killer cant start a download mid game to increase the ping) are the major cause why I keep losing interest in this game.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2017-02-17","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":1112,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"Review updated to match with 1.9.1Some aspects of this game are still flawed amount and stun range of pallets ranking systems priorities for certain interactions (f.i. self healing instead of unhooking after being hit) hitboxes of a variety of objects and bugs.The rank reset (on every 13th of month) puts high ranked Killers into matches with possibly prior low ranked survivors which also makes for a very easy killing spree.As of 1.5 it is no longer possible to view\/look up the Killer's Steam profile which is also an issue as this does not allow a survivor to make sure he isn't being put in a match with Killer they had blocked earlier be it either for a style of gameplay they do not enjoy to play against hackers and so one.I am aware that there are some survivors who will block and report for absoletly ridiculous reasons. On the other hand some Killers will dodge the lobby for ridiculous reasons like having more than 100 playtime hours or private profiles.Also all it takes for the Killer is to click on the Survivor's username in the lobby to see their profile and check their information (unless private). Very biased in my opinion...However although often frustrating this game is a lot of fun even without friends.The variety of Killers with different abilities makes for more alternation in gameplay which also requires a certain amount of skill to be obtained.There is still a lot to be changed about the mechanics of this game but the developers are very active and keep their community up to date all the time.Though in my opinion survivors should get points for the Surviving category based on how long they've been stealthy\/in a match and instead escaping should only give off 3000 points instead of 5000. This would also make for a higher change of not losing a pip when being camped\/mori'd after only a few minutes in or at least getting boldness points when the killer just stays all around you the whole time.I've had many matches in which being stealthy saved my life but eventually a gen will explode in my face when I want to let go of it (bc they hate me) leading to my death because the Killer is just close enough for me to not find a good hiding spot in time and then there's the frustration of depipping even though I had evaded the killer many times throughout the game.Another big wish I'd have is for (repeated) exploiters and hackers to just be permanently banned from the game since it seems that they are just let off way too softly many times.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

You'll be powerless to do anything about it because the devs keep nerfing killers to hell and back to the point that you don't play to enjoy yourself but to entertain survivors. That's right you're seen as their play thing to toy around with. They will tea bag insta blind body block pallet loop and insult you in the end match chat. Not the survivors nor the developers have any respect for the killer playerbase.If you like to have an incredibly frustrating stressful experience and play only to make it so that survies keep playing for our developer overlords you'll love By Daylight.Don't buy this turd.

They have made this game literally so killer oriented that is now impossible to juke a killer that is not blind and if you get hit once you will probably be instantly downed because their \"super rare perk\" that they added with the DLC is owned by every killer that has played more than 4 hours of the game. Their also used to be a free cam for survivors while they were running. GUESS WHAT?! It's gone. You can no longer predict a killer or learn to because you can't see him while running boards no longer stun for a proper duration and some killers can jump over them just as fast as you. Please do not give these people anymore money. They have ruined this game with update after update to favor the already favored killers. They don't deserve it buy Friday the 13th when it comes out instead.

For the survivors it's not a desperate fight for their survival it's a simple walk in the park that's not even challenging and I'm not even talking about pallet loop. Toxic survivors are rampant and doesn't help the overall experience. Bugs are still here and when they fixes something they break something else. Incompetent Devs + Cancer community not a fun game.Unless the game drasticaly changes the way killers and survivors interact in the game I won't see myself get near this game any time soon.After 100 hour of game I can safely say that I have seen around and that it will not get better.

The \"killer\" hosts the game. Listen servers only work well if latency is good. But this game doesn't care about regions. Your killer could be on an island in the middle of nowhere or with a crappy ISP. Or the host plays on a crapp rig. The result is lag.Even worse you do not know until your game has started.Besides being the host gives you a huge advantage as the game is running smoothly for you.2) No real party systemYou want to play with a friend? Tough luck because you cannot! Well since the last patch (July 2016) you technically can but it is incredibly difficult to find a game with two (or three) free slots. I guess the systems works if you are a party of 5...3) MatchmakingNon existant. It's normal to play against higher ranked players with more experience than you (and better perks). Perks are not everything but seriously it's 2016!4) Key BindingsYep you cannot change the default bindings on a PC. Welcome to the stone age of gaming! Truth is there are not many keys to bind in the first place. But I am NOT a WASD player. It's sort of OK if I play as the Killer but it's nearly unplayable as a survivour (sprint and crouch).The game feels extremely unfinished. I would expect a more polished game from a seasoned developer studio.In its current state I cannot recommend this game. This might change if they address the issues mentioned above in future patches.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It will show the killer where s\/he is thanks to one perk.A survivor is far from a hooked mate? Her\/his position will be known by the killer.If you decide to run as a survivor which you most of the time can't avoid to do jokes on you the killer can follow you without having you in sight.If the killer gets you s\/he can easily reach one of the multiple hooks available all around the map making it impossible for the survivor to use the spam \"A D\" dodge mechanic.Good to know as well most of the time if you get hooked by a killer be prepared to get face camped until you die. It's not a problem for her\/him since at the end of the game s\/he will get more bloodpoints (in game currency) than the \"best\" survivor even killing just 1 out of 4. So why even try?Every update is a killer buff never adding new game mechanics for the survivor but implementing new ways for the killers to improve the \"anti fun\" policy.As a final point take into consideration before buying the game that most of the time at least one of the players rages quit may it be the killer or survivor.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2016-11-09","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":408,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"DBD is a fun game but does have quite a lot of bugs. Matchmaking is terrible right now (Veteran rank 1s will get matched with new Rank 20s) which can be quite troubling. Sometimes I also encounter glitchy rocks which makes it hard for me as a survivor to walk\/crouch. The peer to peer system is also something I and other dislike. Because of it you'll sometimes get laggy matches (due to Killer hosting it) which can really make it unfun.That aside you can spend quite some time just screwing around with this game. Seeing great teamplay by your teammates is really refreshing too (bodyblock killers distraction etc..) or when the killer decides to be merciful to you. However most people probably won't reach this point. After all this game has a quite steep learning curve. New players won't immediately become good. It takes time and experience on dealing with the killer to learn how to play well and efficient against them. Learn to be unpredictable in what you do don't ever run in a straight line. Watching videos\/streamers play DBD will also greatly help you improve as both a Killer or Survivor (I highly recommend this!). So basically don't feel bad when you keep dying as a new survivor or lose against good survivors as a new Killer. The Experiences you go through (which includes learning from your losses) is the key to becoming a better player.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2016-06-20","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":433,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Not Recommended","review":"Dead by Daylight was a great idea ruined by incompetent developers. The game was fun at launch but has only gotten worse as the developers insist on balancing the game based on faulty statistics and the complaints of only one side of the community.The game is still asymmetrical but instead of it being a horror game where the survivors hide and sneak around a nigh unstoppable killer it's little more than a bullying simulator where the survivors taunt troll and harass a wounded declawed puppy. Imagine in the Friday the 13th movies instead of the victims running in fear of Jason they take away his machete kick him to the ground and shove his face in the mud. That's essentially the Dead by Daylight experience nowadays. Longstanding balance issues making the killers a chore to play have remained in the game for nearly a year while new killers or mechanics that survivors don't like are nerfed into the ground within a week or two. This is especially true with the A Nightmare on Elm Street DLC where the developers announced their intentions to nerf Freddy into the ground because low rank survivors were having a difficult time against him. Despite the fact that he was already considered laughably weak in high ranks.Does this logic make sense to anyone?Releast a new killer intended to shake up gameplay put game on sale to attract more new players Rebalance new killer based on complaints of these new players. I'm starting to wonder if this is some kinda social experiment to see just how much abuse one side of a community is willing to take before abandoning ship. Bottom line stay far far away from this game if you have any interest of playing killer. It's going the way of Evolve.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Playing as a killer is quite fun but too easy. So most people play as a killer. This makes the matchmaking wait as a killer sometimes take 15 min. or longer. The survivors need to be buffed a bit to match the killer. Right now out of all the games Ive played as a survivor. Ive only escaped legit once. The other two times I escaped were because the killer let us. This is why many people dont wanna play survivor. And from my research in the forums. Many other players feel the same way. So all in all. It would be an amazing game if the Dev would balance it out a bit more. Perhaps make the perks a bit more useful. 12% Is not a number to get excited about on rare perks.

It's so ridiculously stacked in favour of the killer survival doesn't become tense it's just a question of how quick you die. The only time it gets tense is if you hear the 'escape' alert. Especially with some killer perks. Perks that show where survivors are for a time if they are near generators which everyone is because that's the only way to escape. Nearly every map a killer can get to you in that time so you just have to crouch and hope he doesn't check your corner but he knows you're in that area so obviously he's going to. You can't outrun sometimes you can hide if there is a lot of crap around and the killer makes a mistake. Everything you do as a survivor except heal yourself notifies the killers. I've had 15 skill checks repairing a generator. And if the map is inside a building or a built up area there's literally no point in playing survivor.

Unlockable loot keeps you wanting to play so you can unlock new items to use in game. On High settings the game looks great mood is nearly perfect. Makes you rely on your senses and wits to outsmart your opponents. Perks\/Items aren't trashed in private games. Unlike online matches you keep any perks or items used in private games.Cons Performance is below average. Even with a good PC I only get 40 FPS in game. Private or Public. There's no in between. You can't play with two of your buddies and fill the other slots with randoms. No in game voice chat. Communication is important when playing as a survivor. When playing online there's no way to talk or type to your teamates. Repetetive. Grinding out the same game type with only a difference in maps the killer's play type and your perks. Unless you play with friends this game will get old fast. I would say for me that it was worth the $20 because some of my friends own the game. I don't enjoy playing the online game mainly because I'm all alone due to the lack of communication. Though this game is great with friends there should probably be a cheaper method to buy a package deal to give to friends similar to the beta.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The killlers is cool and all have unique perks and abilites. The humans or in this case the victims have unique perks aswell.Dead by Daylight got a lot of smal patches and the dev is also very comunitive and very open about what their vision is about the game.Negative Currently 17.7.16 there is a lot of big and minor bugs boosters and poor matchmaking.I heard and seen many players teaming up with the killers and grinding Bloodpoints and ranks.This game had a lot of \"disconnecters\" whom always disconnect if they die before they could rank up.On the bright side They fixed the disconnect for rank method by punishing disconnects.

I personally prefer playing with a group but playing solo as a survivor can be fun if you're put into a good enough group (as with any game). The perk\/leveling system is done well and the variety of killers makes it interesting to try and adjust your strategy to match the situation. The game can be fun even when matched against killers\/survivors who are much better than you are but the game itself and the framework it's built on ends up stifling a lot of that fun.

The first game was really fun after the first few games the novelty wore off and the horrible balancing issues this game has really shined through.Playing as a new player survivor with other randoms is almost impossible to win the game heavily favors the killer (some of you may say that is how the game is built but I will argue it is a fundamental design failure).As a competitive game (which it has a mode for) it should be balanced but tipping the balance in favour of the killer is therefore a contradiction of the design of a competitive game. In a perfectly balanced game both sides should have an EQUAL chance of winning and that is not the case in this game.Take evolve for instance a beginner of that game still has a good chance of winning any game they play because the monster is balanced towards the other 4 hunters. This game however unless you have team coordinations and extremely good perks you cannot win.For instance playing as survivor no matter what I did it always alerted the killer. Okay so I go to hide? Well the killer can move freely and find me. Okay so I am caught? The timmer till you die in INFINATELY MORE FASTER THAN THE TIME IT TAKES TO SAVE YOU FROM ANOTHER SURVIVOR.It seems you need more skill as a survivor than a killer which is really un balancedIn a perfect world new players going into this game should win at least one of the games they play (e.g. evolve) however this game is completely not balanced for new players.I think the developers really need to pull this game off the shelft or make it open beta had I known this game to be this bad I would've never bought it.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I have not played as much as I wanted and the reason is what everyone knows. The game is Broken.There's a debate going on about this for quite a long time. The issue is the balance. Killers those clowns running around the map have a problem. Is they lack control. I'm not going to talk about how frustrating is to have 3 guys running around you while carrying their friend to a hook forcing you to chose between camp or defeat and either way not having fun. We all know how that feels. We all also know how it feels to have a facecamper in front of us and having to let a friend die. Not funny. At all.How did it come to this? Well if you ask me the game has a good design with a terrible performance. Killers don't have any control of the match. When you play other games of the same style you are able to choose the hunting ground to remove players from the match with a bit of effort. To slow them and hunt them putting odds agaisnt the survivors. To make use of your power as the bloody Killer. But they can't do any of those things. To kill someone you actually need an add on. All you can do is run across the map praying for the dumbass to screw the loop. The lack of power of the Killer side is kinda sad. The problem of the survivors is they have the upperhand but only if they play as a team. And yes after looping some guys and making the killer mad you are probably going to get facecamped but to be honest if you dont face Myers Hillbilly or Leatherface facecamp is easy to deal with. But my point here is survivors are supposed to be a team. There a 0 mechanichs to reward selfish gameplay yet only those who make it out gain points. I believe it would be healthy to reward survivors as a team they work as a team and the guy who looped the mofo allowing the others to repair gens and got facecamped in the end deserves those escape points because without him maybe the rest of the team would not be getting them. I would not mind to allow the killer more \"killing potential\" and dying more often if I get that victory and those points after the match because the rest of my team made it. I don't get mad when I die in Siege but my friends win. So to sumarize Killers should have more control over the match. Survivors should be rewarded as a team. As now. I would not buy the game. I would play Friday 13 or other games where the roles of both factions are actually accurate.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

You're aware of your surroundings and are on constant alert for the killer. Then in the silence a faint heartbeat is heard...you know the killer is close. As the heartbeat gets louder you decide it's better to survive than be caught so you slowly creep away to hide behind a boulder. But it was too late the killer spotted your crouched silhouette and starts lumbering right towards you. You sprint away not worrying about the trail you leave behind all that matters now... is escape. You run looking for any path that could throw him off your trail. The heartbeat is now accompanied by a anxiety inducing grinding noise...you know he's closer. You dodge around trees and hay bales hoping he slips up. The music and heartbeat more intense than ever and now a red glow shines on your back. You know he is right behind you know. Your blood flushes from your head and just as the killer swings their weapon you slam a pallet down between the two of you stunning the killer. As you hear his moans of frustration at his ruined kill you hop through an open window and slowly crawl out into cover. You crouch in hiding as you watch him search the area for you. He eventually give up chase and goes off to find another survivor. You crawl away looking for the next generator to repair and hopefully make way for your escape. If you've ever played Amnesia then you know about the water filled hallway sequence. Dead by Daylight is that...but for the whole time...and it's awesome!This is honestly one of the best games I've played in a long time. Are there balance tweeks to be made? Yes..But every game like this has tweeks to be made. It's a constant balance that doesn't ever really end and I think the devs are doing a great job at it. The feeling of escape or the feeling of a perfect kill is great. Being the last survivor and finally escaping through the hatch after a long cat and mouse game is also one of the big highlights of this game. Dont let the naysayers with \"OP!\" and \"It's BROKEN!\" and \"UNFAIR!\" throw you off... Don't get bitter get better and get this game! Oh...and stay away from the dungeons...bad juju down there.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Being able to choose between the killer or the survivor i feel like it was the ultimate horror game. I will say I'm more of a killer than the survivor but bot are fun. Pros The killers all have different ways to kill you so the matches are always different in terms of what to expect. Playing as a team when being the survivors really makes the game worthwhile while also saying screw a team mate and running for the exit def gives you multiple options on how a match turns out. It is more than just fixing generators really push the killer to the limit and boost your score.Cons Killers camp a lot in this game so it takes away from the match. It has been out for a few so new players dont get discouraged when the \"experts\" run a match like you weren't even there it happens. Just keep playing and you will get it. The lag can ruin a game.I give this game a 9\/10. It really has been awesome.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I honestly thank the dev team for their hard work (And yes I know this game has a lot of bugs but honestly.. if you think you can do a better job then do it) You start off rank 20 and work your way towards rank 1. The ranks reset every month (The 13th of each month) And you unlock different perks and progress through the bloodweb. You also get the shrine where you can save up shards and spend them on teachable perks which any of your character can learn. You can prestige your character after level 50 which means you will lose all the perks and items but you have the chance of getting rare perks and items the more you prestige.

This game loses it's scare factor real quick in public games I'd say in about 8 hours you will be used to it.1. FIX THE ING MATCH MAKING FOR SAKE! God damn dude this game has been out for 4 months. Stop being and adding new killers and fix the basic of the game or add dedicated server listings jesus even most basic valve games have that ... you know why? BECAUSE IT WORKS!2. The cheaters in this game the few I have come accross are pretty annoying and since you can't even fix the above MM I have no faith in any ANTI cheat you have in place for the time being.3. Holy prob going to get on here but what ever it just sucks starting any game new but this one omg if you are a low level survior or killer you are pretty much ed... they will find you like predator when the killer and surviors will evade like ninjas even getting off the hook with a 20% chance its sooooo t thats if can just deal with the MM to take like 30 mins to get into a game to get raped.I would wait till this game goes on sale really cheap and maybe alot new people will get it so you can enjoy it alot more or hell maybe if they can fix the basic problems one day we will have ranked games but for now I'm going to move on.....UPDATE Game is still pretty trash and I only really play it to troll and face camp the salty community in this game.

Seriously I am like super addicted to this game. I play it literally every day and find it hard to stop sometimes. So why do I give this a negative review? The community is super TOXIC! You will rarely find a person that does not get angry salty and just be flat out negative no matter if they won or not. I have been called a hacker baby killer trash dumbass dumb prick and many more things that I care not to mention. Now that I have said this let's get down to the content.This game can be either a lot of fun or just the worst experience you having playing a video game. When you are playing survivor it can be rewarding to be chased by the killer and find ways to mind game and lose him\/her. It can also be very harsh and unforgiving at times. I have had moments where I am being chased all game and when my team has finished all the gens I get screwed by the infamous \"Nobody Escapes Death\" perk. This perk gives the killer a speed boost and doubles their hitting power when all the gens are repaired. When that happens and the killer finally gets you they will camp and force everyone to leave the game so that you can die. That really takes all of the fun out of the game.When playing killer the survivors are always t bagging and bullying you and will try to pallet loop you for days and then when all the gens are done and you finally get that survivor down they use the survivors infamous \"Decisive Strike\" perk. The survivor gets one chance to escape the killers grasp and the killer becomes stunned for a moment for the survivor to escape. This can really hurt the killers experience and make the survivors over confident and just be plain nasty.So as you can see there are ups and downs with this game and unfortunately most of the time there will be downs that totally just suck all of the fun out of the experience. This game can be difficult to win on both sides and survivor and killer mains will always have something to about making the community worse and worse each day. Please save yourself from this highly addictive and super TOXIC game and stay away. It is already too late for me but it isn't for you. You have been warned.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I mean sure Private matches can be fun to play with people you know but if you and your friends want to earn actual points to upgrade you're likely to have more luck selecting to survive separately and then be randomly matched together than if you go in blind. And good luck if one of you wants to be the killer and yet still be paired with each other. For a multiplayer based game it's multiplayer system is lacking horribly.Is it a fun game? For awhile yes. Past it's buggy performance and flawed multiplayer it is an interesting game concept that isn't seen much of. Quirky and hilarious to play on voicechat with others I find myself getting really into the gameplay whether survivor or killer and I've gotten a few good jumps out of being found.Fleeing is satisfying sacrificing is satisfying.It's only fun for so long however.

High majority of bugs which still since release have not been fixed They lied during their beta saying that a lot of the bugs would be fixed by release Rushed the game out before E3 Lazy client side server hosting (which is actually really ing dangerous to YOU as the host can find information of yours if he really wanted to) Unbalanced maps perks mechanics Matchmaking is a ing joke A punishment system which favors more on the killer A highly toxic community (can't really blame them to be fair)The game is fun but only for so long which is why I put some hours into it. But 80% of that time was just annoying and rage inducing because of how when I mess up it feels like it's the game's fault rather than my own. And once you start to notice the lazy work of the developers (just released a patch beer time!) it gets to a point where in this day and age I can not see this as acceptableWe're in 2016 and you release an unbelievably buggy game followed by no patches to fix said buggy game weeks into its release. Do yourself a favor and wait for Friday the 13th the game or Last year the game.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It is a good experience and I enjoyed my time with it however it has some glaring errors that prevent me from recommending this game. First off I lost all of my progress due to a bug and had to start over. It was pretty frustrating. Second was something I noticed while playing the game. As the killer I earn points to \"rank up\" by killing 2 out of the 4 survivors. This means that I can kill 1 playing the game normally and then sit in front of the second survivor and wait. This makes it pretty easy to rank up but is pretty boring and causes everyone to flame you for \"camping \" despite the game ACTIVELY PROMOTING me doing this.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

If you want to waste some time grinding to level up three character so that you can pick a fourth and be invulnerable I suggest be a survivor. Either way the devs have essentially show what looks like a nice juicy triple quarter pounder but in really have taken a massive corn filled that for some reason has shards of glass in it and forcefully shove it down your throat while promising it s a balanced nutritional meal. I ve deleted and installed this game time and time again. Everytime I come back to it with a good heart and intent to grind through the crappy gameplay and try to be a good Killer of course I end up switching to survivor halfway through each reset because it is so much easier to play. And then I realize that one of three things will occur. 1. I will face one of three killers that everyone plays because they re the only viable option. 2. I will face a killer that has no hope of getting a kill unless the survivors are just truly awful. And 3. My favorite is that I ll run into a killer that so wants to be a successful killer so bad that they cheat. The most common I see is an ESP or minor speed boost which is just enough to ruin the game. Wanna hear something even funnier. The devs are absolute ing trash at the game. Unless they play with some high end items or they play with other devs or they play in a test built with their latest crap idea. You will never see a decent dev at this game. That s because they re all and most of the updates they make are to make them better. Funny how you always see them playing survivor.Lastly. Survive with friends. While I do enjoy rolling up with my friends the fact that you can use a third party application to voice chat with your friends literally ruins a match. Honestly if I see a party of three or four come into the game when I play killer I leave the lobby because i d rather tie my nut sack to a closed door in a busy building than play that match.Dev s I ve owned this game since it first came out. I ve tried to support it. I ve tried hard but I m done giving a about it and paying you salaries. Uninstalling for the last time and honestly if I had the option or the skill I d find a way to delete this game from all existence so nobody would ever inject themselves with the cancer that is DBD it s community and the development team.Go ahead and hide my comment go ahead and ban me from your game all I want is my 60 bucks I ve spent on this holocaust of a game.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I bought this game expecting to have around 10 hours played in total as i'd get bored however the grind to reach high levels doesnt feel like a grind at all with the daily challenges and it always feels like you're getting something new in the bloodweb which changes up your game slightly. In the recent update where they changed the hooks it has helpoed against the camping killers by allowing a hook rotation so they can no longer block the survivors from saving thier friends. Many people don't like the survive with friends feature mainly because if they main killer they dont want the survivors to work together this is kind of dumb and if you think swf shouldn't be in the game you're probably a salty killer that went up against good players. There is also a ranking system which resets monthly which helps you play against people your own skill level. is very good get game","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I bought this game on sale for 9.99 and within I would say within 5 matches I went and bought all the dlc (not necessary by any means to get extreme joy from this game). I did not know that I already had access to all the levels (trials) and wasnt limited to matchmaking by not having them.Anyways if you're searching for that addictive video game fix because you're chasing the \"gaming dragon\"... stop right here and purchase. Watch gameplay footage on youtube. This game is so intense I still shout profanitys by being startled. So much fun playing the killer and the survivor. I have won as the killer about 3 games (managed to kill all the survivors) and escaped as a survivor about 20 (played many more games as a survivor). Even if you lose on either side you still get xp to level up any character of your choosing. That being either survivor or killer. Easy to learn with a very high grading curve of mastering what you're doing. I will pour many more hours into this game. It is heavily populated so it doesnt normally take more than a minute for a match to start when you search for a game. Normally about 20 seconds for me.My complaints and a heads up Host of the match (trial) is the killer and your latency depends on your connection to him. You can see the latency before readying up for the match. Red is bad. Don't play a match with bad latency or you can expect to rubber band a lot. If the killer leaves the match you get a win as a survivor and the game obviously ends (good). With that being said after the match is over and you're chatting up your gg's and what not when the killer leaves the lobby the chat goes with him (sad). Minor bugs in the matchmaking menu that can be fixed by restarting the game. This only seems to occur when I switch from playing survivor a couple of games in a row over to playing the killer. Idk... sometimes I have to restart steam otherwise ill get stuck in matchmaking. Easy fix minor annoyence.Thats about it. Watch some beginner tip guides on youtube before you start. Nothing more annoying than a survivor who gets himself killed within the first three minute of the game from sprinting down the middle of the map.I gave these guys like sixtyish bucks in all so I hope they use it and keep improving the game and not be spending it on cocaine and hookers.I use a 360 controller and remapped my skill check from LB to A. Feels more comfortable that way and didn't conflict with anything else.Enjoy. glhf","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Very much so. Because it has a large community and you can get into games generally pretty fast compared to other 4V1 games. I got this for free and then bought it soon after.HOWEVER the DEVS need to seriously get with the program!!!!!!! (You can either read the book I posted or watch this short video.)https \/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v d31kV K0cXw&amp feature youtu.beAs of this review I have experience bugs and glitches that have not been fixed despite my game having to update constantly. Usually these \"updates\" are simply to add some cosmetics to the game or whatever. That urks me. You take time to add that pointless junk but not prioritize your major issues people are having. IT'S SAYING SOMETHING WHEN YOUR BUG FORUM IS THE SECOND LARGEST FORUM IN YOUR GAME!! It's about 15k posts!!!! COME ON ALREADY! THE CONS First off before you buy the game or test it be advised that you will get stuck in loading screen loops.. very often.. especially at lower survivor levels. This glitch doesn't seem to appear when you play as killer despite level. Second there are bug abusers you will find people able to use weapons that are not intended for the killer they have. Like Nurse is able to use Billy's chainsaw.. this is not intended but it happens.. and it's very absurd.Third your perks will randomize as a survivor.. like.. I place my perks in an order I need them in as a survivor.. so I can see the notifications easier each perk gives as a result.But despite so many attempts to keep perks at a certain order.. the game will CONSTANTLY randomize them in whatever order it chooses once you enter the match. This throws me off and makes it very difficult to see if the killer is nearby. I want my perks left the way I intended them to be.. not how the glitchfest wanted them to be.Forth you will find people with large egos.. you will find killers that will stalk you the entire match ignoring your comrades that run about them.. And some killers on top of this you can't seem to shake off you can crawl run walk they'll find you. They'll just keep following you around the map and finally if they do catch you which they normally do because you can only be chased for so long before it annoys the feces out of you.. they'll camp you and smack you when they hook you. Just to add insult to injury.. you WILL run into people like this.Fifth you will find players and experience this yourself where you bounce around as if lagging.. it's almost like you're losing considerable framerate and you're in one place at one minute and then at an entirely different place the next minute.. despite your ping being perfectly fine.Sixth the DEVS don't seem to want to or even consider making bugs a priority.. some bugs are annoying but can be overlooked while others are ultimately game breaking.People have been complaining and complaing.. the bug forums are filled with the stuff I mentioned.. and it doesn't seem like the DEVS even care. Eventually people are going to wise up or ANOTHER GAME is going to be released that has DEVS who actually LISTEN to the COMMUNITY.. but by that time.. it'll be too late for this game and it'll be old news. And when that happens the DEVS of DbD will have NO ONE to blame but THEMSELVES.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2016-12-30","funny":1,"helpful":3,"hour_played":353,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"Now the only solid reason for me recommending this game is its very successful delivery of both immersion and suspense as well as it being a very fun game to play with friends in both online or private matches. However before purchasing their are some drawbacks you should now about that greatly affect the game's overall quality.Queue times may be long at times and certain loading screens may become forever stuck killers always have priority over the server as the host and this can cause inumerous amounts of lag at times that takes away from the games immersion and one of the biggest drawbacks for me is the fact that currently if a killer were to start the match fully with survivors they have the capability of leaving the match or disconnecting from the match for whatever reason it may be and this unfortunately can cause survivors to lose their offerings or survivor rank due to the match ending but without enough time to gather bloodpoints needed to advance.Certain killers have even exploited this against me and have left the match moments before myself and 2 friends were about to escape the map due to this killer not being able to capture any of us and this of course made us all lose a pip in our survivor rank as well as our offering.So overall the game is very entertaining to play but many issues need to be fix before the playerbase will truly be able to enjoy it.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I'll summarise the positives\/negatives for a clear overview of the experience. Positive Atmospheric procedural maps Unique tense premise Effective balancing Unique killer traits (Invisibility Trapping and Chainsaw Charge)Negative Minimal customisation to appearance (implied otherwise from concept art) Superficial perks Superfluous items 3 maps 3 killers 4 survivors Identical functionally to BETA Overall the experience is highly enjoyable but it's severely restricted in content which is impossible for the community to improve from a lack of mod support and the perks\/items are shallow (at best) to have minimal impact on the experience for a higher dynamic playthrough each time. However the three maps which are sadly limited to three for theme\/setpieces do have unique placement for the objective(s) and these do foster a degree of variety. For 15 it's worthwhile for those craving this unique premise no alternatives available but I'd recommend one to wait until there are competitors or this receives considerable updates as it's currently equal to the BETA overall in content.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Where to start.I've so far only played it for a bit over 6 hours total so I'll do my best to say what I think of it.I really enjoy it.I didn't think I would since it's not my sort of game ... But given the chance it's really not what one thinks.It's more than the standard type of horror game. It plays with the mind stimulating the fear if you're a victim and stimulating the psychopathic killer in all of us when playing as the killer.I'm still not sure which part of the game I enjoy more being the killer or being the victim. Pros It has a uniqueness about it I've not seen in any other game. Ever.I like the fact it has a first person view when you're the killer and a third person view when you're a victim.Both aspects have a completely different way of playing and both aspects are completely fun.Cons I've noticed a few glitches within the game. Each one was from a victim standpoint.Fixing the generator and killer clubs me and picks me up we both get stuck at the generator and even with another victim coming back to help me still couldn't help me.Another was being bashed to the ground to the point of crawling away victims came to heal me but couldn't and killer couldn't pick me up to put me on hook ...First time as a victim was on hook someone helped me off and I was wedged in the beam that supports the hook and couldn't get out at first. Can't seem to play with the same people unless you're playing against friends in private match mode ( not really a problem.. but it would be nice to be able to make new friends.. )Other than the few very minor bugs I HIGHLY recommend this game.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The game caters and encourages the most obnoxious to keep playing it. For how much money they milk into this game there isn't nearly enough content. MOst of the recommendations for this are from people who played it for free for a week or so. They should really make that \"check this box if the game was free\" manditory if you haven't bought the thing. The game uses League of Legends systems to keep you playing the same thing over and over again. As you play you unlock perks which are incrimental statistical changes So once you get past the nastalgia and horror elements you're basically playing the same game over and over with people who know how to exploit every goofy mechanic and then whine afterwards whether they won or lost. I honestly wish there was a way to just turn off chat entirely or kick someone you recognize as an asshat or any way to remotely control who you play with but the game itself doesn't even really organize people by their \"rank\" which is your win\/lose rate it just plops you with people who have every perk and know every glitch\/cheap method to win with absolute beginners.I feel bad for anyone first playing this game thinking its going to be fun Its just waaaaay to expensive its a money milker.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

My only problem with this game is the rank system. Sure rank doesnt dictate EVERYTHING. But it sure makes one hell of a difference when you are a level 19 killer with a blood web of (4). LITERALLY never having a match with anyone above rank 15.. with over (10) bloodweb! And i get that your goal is to get as many points as possible to RANK UP. So killing is not always the single best way to do so. The game just feels to easy for surviors you can heal without having a health kit! (not yourself tho) There can be more then one of the same charector which can make the game broken when you have all botonists healing themselves faster then you can chase them down! The game becomes unplayable when everyone surpasses your rank by (10 15) Levels per person. Also i feel unhook times should be slightly longer and maybe slap on a quick time event as well.. since you love those. Its no fun when the survivors always have you by the balls not the other way around.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Mainly because the ammount of game breaking mechanics this game has.. They constantly release patches that totally break things about the game. The current and most recent patch really did a number. Playing as survivor is nearly impossible to win They made it so you will nearly always get hit when using pallets or windows to escape. \"since they increased killers lunge attack range. It honestly isn't even the biggest issue though. Since day one. The trapper. \"one of the killers\" has been incredibly over powered. For the simple fact. If he lays a bear trap at the feet of someone he hooks. And you watch him place it mind you. You can't disable the trap. Only the unhook option is available. It's so frusterating because at this point you have a choice. You can fully abandon your teamate\/friend to die a horrible death. Or you can take a chance in saving them which WILL and I mean that. no way around it. One of you will land in the bear trap. If it's the hooked person. he grabs them. rehooks them. they instantly die. Or. it hits you \" the savior\" and you get hooked and likely get left for dead. \"or he just places another trap and wala. You're dead. It's really sad honestly. A simple switch action button could of prevented all of this. yet the devs refuse to acknowlage this issue. because of the game breaking mechanics making this game nearly unenjoyable. I have to give this game a not reccomended. It's a great game to be honest. But it's killed by the fact so many bugs \/ issues exist and haven't been fixed yet.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Where there was once love from the developers there's just mandatory check ins to say \"Yep we're still updating the game.

I was matched with 3 other survivors with a single perk (one had an uncommon and the other two had single rare perks). How is it possible that we were matched against a rank 15 killer with 4 ultra rare perks (No One Escapes Death Insidious Whispers and Spies from the Shadows)? I'd venture to say that the most important issue this game has is the terrible matchmaking. I think folks would be willing to cope with the DC's lobby issues lag broken infinites broken perks bugs etc. but the poorly designed illogical matchmaking system makes it boring for the high ranked people to play. At the same time the new people trying to enjoy your game are quickly discouraged from playing. I have had the same issues with trying to play killer. Low rank low level killers also get matched with high rank high level survivors. If the developers continue to keep the poor matchmaking in the game beginners will be frustrated and quit and experienced players will get bored with the game and quit. It's a shame. The concept of the game is great. The music goes well with the action. I won't recommend this to my friends until the matchmaking is resolved. I would hate to introduce them to a game that will put them in the situation I just experienced. I don't see it as anything different than the developers forcing high ranked and experienced players to cheat.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},
{"date_posted":"2018-06-22","funny":1,"helpful":2,"hour_played":408,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"I feel like it is time for me to review this game. This review will explain the premise of the game and what game play consists of!OverviewDead by Daylight is a 4vs1 horror game where one player is a killer and the other four are survivors. The killer cannot be killed so the survivors have to work together to stay hidden and finish five generators which will power the exit gates so that they can then escape. The killer has to hit the survivors twice to down them and then hook them on meat hooks where they can then be saved by other survivors.GameplaySurvivorAlmost every action is further progressed by doing skill checks for example when you are repairing a generator or healing at random points a circle will come up where you have to press space bar in a certain area to complete a successful skill check these can be a bit difficult at first but are easy to learn with practice.Actions will still progress even without skill checks but skill checks provide a quick small addition to the progress of the action though failing a skill check will slightly regress the actions progress!Perks items and addons are all gained through the bloodweb a sort of spider web where you can spend bloodpoints earnt in game every time you complete a bloodweb you will level up this goes on to a maximum of level 50 where you can either prestige or continue levelling to gain items perks and addons. The absolute maximum level is prestige 3 level 50.All survivors move at the same speed though perks certain perks affect some movement speeds a running survivor with no movement boosts speed is considered 100%. Survivor sizes differ with (from my experience) Claudette being the smallest and Bill being the largest. Every survivor has 3 unique perks that are unlocked at levels 5 10 and 15 and then become teachable (availible to all characters) at level 30 35 and 40. KillerAll killers have a unique ability which cannot be taught to other killers though same as survivors their perks can they also have the same perks unlock levels max level and prestige system as survivors.Killers do not have to complete any skill checks to progress actions.Killers also level up through the bloodweb in the same way as survivors and gain perks item and addons from this.Killers do move at different speeds with The Nurse being the slowest at 96% speed and The Trapper Hillbilly Wraith and Shape (Tier 2 3) being the joint fastest at 115% speed. These are the walking movement speeds not including things such as invisibility as the wraith or chainsaw sprint as the Hillbilly and are not including any movement buff perks or addons.RanksThere are 20 ranks which go from 20 (the worst) to 1 (the best) killers and survivor ranks do not affect each other for example if you lose a survivor game your killer rank will be unaffected and vice versa.Each rank has a certain amount of pips inside it (the lower rank have 3 mid have 4 and high have 5) ProsInteresting and addictive gameplay with a wide variety of killers survivors maps playstyles.Every game feels unique and fun you will always be on your toes ready to either pounce as the killer or feeling dread as you know the killer could be round every corner as a survivor.Has a ranking system which gives you a rough indication of how good a player you are.Killing survivors is extremely satisfying!Although the game is a bit of a grind it is definitely not boring to improve and level up.Games usually feel relatively fair.ConsPeer to peer system instead of servers (based off the killers connection) means that as a survivor if the killer has bad connection it can be a very frustrating experience!Some minor bugs which can occasionally be frustrating.DLCIMPORTANT Even if you do not own any of the dlc you can still play against dlc killers and with dlc survivors you can also play on all the dlc maps and see any dlc items.There are currently 2 free dlc addons to the game and 3 paid ones all the dlc are fairly priced and each adds one new survivor and killer to play and a new map for all to play.None of the DLC add an overpowered killer or survivor so you do not feel at a disadvantage if you do not own them.There are also a few survivor and killer cosmetic packs.SummaryAll scoring is out of 10 Graphics 8 Art Style 8 Customisation 7.5 Gameplay 9.5 Music\/Sound 8.5 Overall 8.5 If you find any incorrect information spelling mistakes typos etc please inform me!If you found this helpful please up rate it as it took me a long time to write!","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It's like being the director of a horror movie and manipulating things and of course there will always be the odd death that happens. All in all it's a fun game and if they clean up the cheats and make the lobby match making work better it would be a top lister for me.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

When they swing to hit you then you dodge it and you have a good few inches away from it. The matchmaking sucks. You get killers that have like thousands of hours in the game. And they kill you with no chance of survival. Then there is the killers speed. You are running away from the killer and they catch up to you really fast its stupid.

{"date_posted":"2017-12-16","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":69,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Not Recommended","review":"I'll rate this negative because I want devs and players pay attention also it means the game can be quite horrible if players in the game show no sense of morality Rewarding on the Killer side (pro) Punishing on the survivor side (con)I have fair amount of reasons for my review. So I recently started this game as survivor a lot of killers face camp or camp around their victim once they are on the hook however this can be prevented easily if developers develope an anti camp system for killers just like we have one for survivors (Camping somewhere throughout the game can end up reavling your location to the killer by crows which is a very good way to prevent camping and keeping the game as hostage)Also the bloodpoint and bloodweb system I just make it simply like this if you're a killer whether you kill or not you'll get fair amount of bloodweb and the main focus of your game will be on your rank (Which as you know on Rank level 1 you'll end up against Rank level 1 survivors so some killers favor rank level 20 so they can harvest as much as bloodpoint they want on newbies or baby survivors) and on the other hand you can harvest crazy amount of bloodweb and get your perks much much faster than survivors which will give huge advantages to the killer when you compare it to a killer without any perks.On the other hand survivros have to tryhard both for their rank and the bloodpoints they gain throughout the game. A guy who really performed great as a survivor against me while I was playing as a killer just got 7 000 bloodpoints while once all survivors escaped and I recieved 17 000 bloodpoints which I think it's not fair Killers should be punished as much survivors are. and this makes the game very unbalanced.If I give you specific examples It's some DLCs for example the Sparkle of Insanity The Doctor killer you can literally spam the out of the shocker then camp. without any negative consequence. So you have infinite number of shock waves sending to survivors.Those who has played against such killers understand when the fun is slaughtered by the killer because \"Blame the game not players with lack of morality in their gameplay\".Before buying this game realize if you have friends and fun is your first goal then be aware that there are Rank s who only care about bloodpoints so you might see your teammate on the hook and the killer standing right infront of him till he dies and entity gets him and they he has to wait for you to either die or escape which will make it insanly boring and screwed up from the fun aspect. or when the killer is just spamming and abusing things which can be easily prevented by the developers because the game at the current state is unbalanced.To those who say rank up on higher ranks it will get better it's not a solution It's called adaptation to a situation which has to be fixed by developers. We're not talking about facts like there are no servers in this game and Killers are the host which gives them advantages I've played as a killer and seen this advantages when he throws down the pallet but I hit him before it happens. It's very bad and since I do not have NASA internet or do not get any money from developers of Dead By Daylight I can not fix my internet so they'll get 20 30 ping. (Sorry not sorry)To those who say In real life it should be like this Killers should be stronger.We're playing a video game get out of your dreams some of us play video games to escape from the real life which some gamers have never ever experienced becuase all they've done is to sit on their and playing video games as their lifetime commitment.In the end I rate this negative. so it can be seen I play this game myself as both killer and survivor whenever I can but I want to warn other people if you don't have the nerve to tolorate people who can not play a game in a fun friendly and fair manner then do not buy this game.And It's the developers mistake. The game was all about Brain at the beginning when it was released but now It's all about perks and without them specially in the survivors' section you have high chance of dying over and over unless being CARRIED by your mates.Cheers !","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The graphics are nicely done with absolutely gorgeous or goregeous characters in it and astonishing maps to play on. With every new chapter that's getting released it becomes a little more interesting since this is not just a plain survival game but also has a lot of varities thinking of the many different killers that can be played. Since it is an online game it doesn't get boring over time even though it's always the same goals to reach yet it's a great place to meet people to play with.The Dead by Daylight community is welcoming sometimes full of male sex organs and sandbaggers but also full of fun people. And what do you do when you get sandbagged? Just do the same fluffin' thing and learn how to juke or tell the others your opinion in the chat after the game results are shown! Everyone loves nice criticism.But in all reality I really enjoy this game and am not going to stop playing it any time soon. I am fascinated by the design sound and ideas the developers come up with in every patch or chapter. If you're into routine like but also diversified survival game Here it is!Enjoy be nice (or sandbag and troll the hell out of people and open up a Funny Random Moments Montage on YouTube like some of us did) and just have fun because still it's just game. ) But a really awesome one so cheers to the developers even though it is still full of bugs!","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It is not particularly scary but can get your heartbeat up! The killer designs are not extremely creative but they offer fun spin on the types of killers from horror genre. There is a lot of negativity surrounding this game because it must be hard to balance it right. Killers are complaining that it is hard for them to kill survivors and the survivors think it is too hard for them to survive so I really think that the game is balanced right because nobody is truly happy. There is a nice system of upgrading your character with perks and so on. It needs more maps and maybe different game mode with different objective for the killer and survivor but I am sure that the developers are doing what they can. There is a loud minority complaining about everything but I think the game is really worth the money and I personally never met anybody mean in game. On this forums....its different story! So buy it if you like these types of game.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

This is a horror escape type game where it involves getting started 5 generator around the path you is placed into. a twist in it is that you are not alone as you have 3 other survivors with you. You have a killer that can quickly surprise you and take you down from the game by beating you down and hang up on a hook. Currently there are 4 types of killers that all have different types of ability suchs as invicibility traps chainsaw and teleport. This game is incredibly fun while very difficult for the killer or survivor is adept with his role .Be warned that this is my own opinions apon to this game so please do not get triggered by these.pros The game has a very balanced grading. It is very skill based. The graphic of the game is almost stunning when you play it on the highest settings making the game more realistic. Fast matchmaking easy to find a match (If you play alone) Different ways to play your charakter. meaning that you can be the leader who boost other players speed. or sabotaging the killers traps and hooks and so on which I really love. Its unique. by that i mean I havn't seen any survival horror games like this as a multiplayer. Cons Matchmaking system is terrible. yes you might find a match really quick but you might be coming against rank 1 killers and so on who are way more experienced then others or you could end up with people who are far less known to the game. This can lead you to a quick death in game. Matchmaking with friends... never seen such bad match making system for co op. it will start off by saying searching for a match and then instantly stop right after saying no match found. And if you were to find one you might be kicked because of the lack of space there is in one room. This si something that should be fixed by priotising people who play in groups so they can join the game. There is lack of story driven in this game meaning they won't say so much about the different killers and survivors unless you go on wikipedia or the creators webpage which i find quite annoying. I would love to see some sort of many gamemode that allows us to know more about the killers and survivors.Would I recommand people to buy this? yes ofc! 15 Euro is actually quite cheap for this game.I recommand this game to pretty much everyone who loves horror games and team based players because its really fun.This is just my opinions and I hope you find this usefull.

But it relies on \"leveling up\" and unlocked and stockpiling perks and add ons. This is dumb. It makes it so if you're a late comer to the party you wander in as a new monster expecting to get rolled and then some survivors with \"instant repair\" kits and such roll you so fast you hit them maybe once or twice. A half dozen games later and you understand it to a point. Being a survivor feels helpless fine. But then you hit end game and realize the monster could see you for 30 feet through walls if you were anything other than pristine (or in some cases even if you were fine and were healing someone else). You don't have that ability because you haven't played for 200 hours. Makes ing sense. Do away with this t.

{"date_posted":"2017-02-09","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":191,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"I think the game is fun but being a killer sucks at the moment. If several suriviors have a toolbox or that perk that lets you sabotage without them they can literally make it so you have two options try to get them to the basement or let them bleed out on the ground which nets you almost no blood points. I propose that you should make it so that some hooks can be destroyed but not every aboveground hook on the map. Literally once they destroy all the aboveground hooks they just run around since it won't really matter if you see them. Seriously this is why people play survivor more than killer since you can beat the killer so easily with this strategy especially at higher levels where most people have the perk. And it isn't as if you can defend the hooks since the hitbox for someone when the sabotage a hook is strangely small. Also you need to get a better anticheat since their are people who can finish a generator solo with no toolbox instantly which is always annoying. That and the issue of people who use speed hacks since sprintburst isn't infinite. that fact that reporting them for cheating doesn't work most of the time makes them very brazen about it literally saying that they use hacks in the post game chat. Also the matchmaking system breaks whenever I try to be a survivor so maybe one out of five tries will get me into a game and I have to restart after each fail. That and there is always the issue of people not loading in all the way so we start with 3 2 survivors instead of four screwing the survivors over. this happens to me when I play killer or survivor.I'd reccomend this game but I'd only reccomend playing killer if you want to be frustrated since survivors are always cheating quitting or making ti impossible to kill them in any effective way. You could solve the no hooks issue with iron grasp or agitation but I have only agitation level one and iron grasp is annoyingly rare. Of course you could make it so the killer can repair hooks it just takes a while or make it so sabotaging hooks temporarily disables them allowing them to be used later or requiring th killer to interact with them first. either that or remove sabotaging hooks since that wouldn't hurt survivors very much especially since the game is currently unbalanced in survivor's favor.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Then when you finally find a game don't be the first one to get hung up by the killer because he will just sit there and watch you die. Seeing as he only needs 1 kill to get a win and not lose rank that of course is the obvious choice for him. And everybody who's played for a little bit knows this and won't even try to rescue you knowing that. But should you win prepare for killers ragequitting as they are the host everybody will disconnect and you won't get rewarded anything. Which basically means that you've now succesfully wasted 15 minutes in a queue + 10 minutes ingame 25 minutes.Other than that this is a really awesome game once you actually play with proper people! If they manage to fix issues like making a proper queue system and giving penalties for a camping killer + adding that he has to get more than 1 sacrifice to get a win. THEN then they will have a really nice game! So basically unbearably bad when you're not ingame but really good fun once you get ingame! I'm running it on a rather old system but it still is sorta badly optimized as well. As I have hopes for the future of this game I would recommend it although at this state I would wait and give the devs more time to fix their issues with this game.

At times it can be frustrating and salt may reach maximum capacity but it's tons of fun and very addicting.Each character starts off different from eachother but after enough bloodpoint investment you can more or less use one you like as a template for various perks. There are also usable and passive items to help you each match. As you level up the bloodweb you unlock more perks and items to make use of eventually being able to turn the perks into teachables for other characters.The maps are fairly dark and foggy with plenty of places to hide and pallets spawned throughout the map to slow the killer. Each map is large enough for 7 generators but only 5 need to be completed to reach safety. Alternatively a situational hatch may also grant escape.+Stealth gameplay+Perk system+Co op required+Lots of characters+Lots of items+Customization+Good map variation Killer balance Matchmaking Steep learning curve Weak tutorial","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

My review will be positive however. I actually really enjoy playing this games the sense it gives you when the killer spots you and you need to flee are intoxicating. The gameplay makes sense and is usually without issue. Sometimes however the game can be a real pain. Many times the game will not load up survivor matches and will instead give me an infinite loading screen which can only be gotten rid of through the Task Manager. Other times the game will have really horrible pairings. i.e. a noob survivor vs. a pro killer and vice versa. However even with the faults this game has I would still recommend this game to others. I recommend it to people who are willing to be patient with the game and wait until a match is finally started. It takes time but if you really want to know the truth it's worth every penny and worth struggling through its faults. If you don't like it get a refund. Side Note I will say though that the game's developers should really focus on fixing some issues of the game instead of adding DLC and cosmetics.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Being a killer is like trying to open the worlds toughest pickle jar with your toes. This new ranking system makes pipping incredibly hard for killers as it really hurts you in ways you really can't control. In fact it seems to reward you for camping a survivor which is not fun for either party. It is also worth noting that bugs are incredibly common and rarely fixed. When they are they've been in the game for quite awhile. I rather like this game but it's honestly not worth the time nor the money I invested in it. It's rather sad.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

This so called asymmetrical game is rather just an one sided game in favor of the killer.

Especially since the last patches (lesser amount of pallets father lunge attacks by the killers) and the new introduced killer there is almost no counterplay for the survivors. In most cases the killer just needs to find one of the survivors and then simply camps the hook (no punishment and no counterplay since you need to rescue hooked teammates to get enough points).Tl dr unbalanced game play killer or dont even start to playUpdate Fix the ing matchmaking!

Or for those that dont like to grind endlessly for characters via blood points. 4.99 if you can wait long enough. 20 dollars? LMAO. No. Just...No.Its full price for those that love the grind and the perk\/exploit scene. For those that love to exploit silly and gamebreaking perks and powers that are put in for killer handholding purposes. Killers get insta spotting powers ruin hexes (breaks game on smaller levels entirely) and basically i win perks that makes players just either DC or end the game by giving up. When you design a game around a perk system it makes the game all about finding the exploit perks only. The game was by far better when you had survivors and killers PERIOD. The skills\/perk system just muddies the water too much. Now all the Pros spam RUIN and the lamest hexes that force survivors to go totem hunting. And they do it for the SOLE purpose of just extending his \"find the survivors early\" time. Because survivors start near gennies and get quick times to start them. Large map? Much harder to execute w\/ ruin and other hexes and better balanced. Small map? LMAO. You'll be lucky if half your team doesn't DC INSTANTLY! Or throw the match by just letting the killer win. Its a joke.Graphics? 2008 Graphics settings? None. Low medium high and ultra. And that's it. Eveyrone plays low because its eaisier to see. Config file changes? Ignored entirely.Can't disable AA w\/o turning game to low settings. LMAO. Everyone plays them because it is advantageous. Things are by far clearer.Too dark? Up your gamma. Lots of people do it.Hackers? Probably a lot of them. Hard to know for sure. All you need is a wall hack. Plenty of exploiters though. Sound? Can't turn off music. Controls aren't bad. Gennies zones aren't bad to hit but with Hex ruin too hard on survivors to hit and only there to hold the killers hands.Beyond that its a around and a griefers paradise only. Grinding just keeps people playing and keeps the game on the steam stats list longer and therefore makes gamers think its \"good\". Its fun yes but not for long. But dont do the ranked matches. This game is not ESPORTs like the devs want it to be. Coming back to it after a time makes replaying an \"i remember what i hated about this\" kind of experience. Not fun long term after you spot the flaws.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Does it execute this simply premise? The answer is.... kinda. There's a few reasons i don't recommend the game in it's current release state.First reason is balance and the severe lack thereof. Survivors are stupidly overpowered once you start giving them perks. 20 second cooldown speed boosts healing that is capable of recovering your bloodied state quicker than the killer can recover from hitting you being able to infinitely jump through sets of windows where the killer has zero chance of killing you. Those are just the few things the killer has going against them the other is the fact that if a survivor doesn't want to lose rank they pull the plug on their internet to D\/C which comes with 0 penalty for the survivor other than you don't get your bloodpoints for that match but the killer gets nothing which results in them losing rank.Also since it isn't including in it's release state even though the devs have said they are going to implement it is for a game based on 4v1 not having the survive with friends mode available at launch is also bad.If you're playing as the survivor you better pray your killer host has a stable internet connection. This leads to another important issue that was overlooked for launch. In a game where the killer is the host why don't you have a region option for connections or a browser for games where you can see the hosts ping. Releasing a game right at E3 then going to said convention as your game is being blown up by critics for game inbalances D\/C's going unpunished and punishing the killer for them seems a bit off.Now i've finished bashing the game there's a good game underneath the inheirant problems surrounding the game. The fact that they held a beta that lasted all the way until 2 days from game release was another oversight that if it allowed people to progress to test it further might have prevented these issues.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The killer is faster than you can hit you as long as your're close the only thing that survivors had to get away were a couple infinites which have been removed or \"Fixed.\" Now when you jump out of a window if you dont have a certain perk youll be stunned for a second. THe killed got a new lunge which allows him to charge forwards and hit you if you're close enough even though he can already run faster than you. This game is atrocious and no matter how much the community complains that killers are OP you will always have those who defend and the devs are only making the survivors worse with each update. For example they just released a new killer called the Nurse. She can teleport or blink forward. Doesnt matter if you throw down a pallet or anything she can avoid those. When she hits you she has an ability to see where you're at in a certain radius. So lets say you're playing and she swings and hits you you will never be able to get away from her unless she is ing stupid. She will follow you until she kills you because she will know where you're at. Thats absolute garbage. Survivors cant survive anymore if the killer is good.

There's no sense of fear from the survivors who consistently pallet loop and run you in circles every single game which is really not fun for anybody really. This game is one of the most toxic i have ever played worse than cs go worse than pubg it's really bad. Post game chat as killer is a nightmare survivors have a go at you for every tiny thing whether it be patrolling generators or chasing someone who is trying to unhook their friend. SWF ( lobbied up friends) is awful too the game was made to have no communication between survivors but having you and your buddies in a discord really ruins the surprise element of some of the killers (MM Wraith Freddy etc.).All in all yes the game is great especially on sale and if you can look past the toxicity and blatant favouritism of survivors by the devs or if you play survivor this game is really great and even with all these flaws it's still probably my favourite game I've played this year.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I love the concept of this game. And it really pains me to do this but I'm going to have to give this a thumbs down. The game is beautiful. The rounds are pulse pounding and exciting. You find yourself jumping when a killer catches you off guard and you really get a feel for the immersion. The level up system is solid if a bit OP on the survivor side. The problem with this game and it's a big one is the fact that YOU WILL FREEZE UP. In every match. Always. I have frozen up temporarily in every single match I've played as the killer allowing the players to literally dance in front of me while they finish their generator repairs or looting. It's not a connection issue. It's a glitch that occurs when some loser quits a match early. Only the host a.k.a the killer is forced to lock up while the rest of the survivors go about their merry ways. I've lost rare one time use items and all of my points from being forced to quit a match just to end it. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! It should have been tested enough to work these problems out before launch. End of story no excuses. This is poor design and it harkens to the devs being too lazy to hammer out their product. I hope they fix this issue soon but I must recommend that nobody else buys this game without these bugs being fixed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED!","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Toxic community (really one of the most shity community ever). I had to block my comments cuz everygame when i killed someone as killer or juke someone as survi i get thrashtalked in lobby then blamed in comments. But.... this game is just good to play. U dont even feel this hours of gameplay. The best is ubdates and conntent really often but some patches are totally ts. And ye survivors are strong but balance team have no idea what to do with that. So they nerf everythink and checked how this gonna work. Bugs are problematic but meh gameplay is anyway good. I can reccomend that but u need to collect team because survive with friends is the best what game can offer to you. Really thats the best part of this game. Without this hmm.. this game would be really really bad and unplayable as survi. Randoms are totally random 9 of 10 only care about themselves and didnt help you even if u help everyone the whole game. You flashlight killer 3 times ? You help 3 people ? OH you first time get cought and you are at hook ? sorry survivors open gates see ya friend !! As i say community is and thats the biggest problem of that. But generaly game is really good and fun to play. One think is really hmm unfair ? Smurfs at ranks and ranking. When i have break or play survi not killer i get 17 16 rank im just winning 20 matches in row with 4 kills its boooooring sometimes. And unfair to survivors how people with 1 300 hours can play vs guy who have 900 hours and got another acc with 900 hours ? There should be some tiers like diamond tier platinium tier or whatever u named it and there should be ranks idk from 10 to 1. And reset is hmm 3 4 mouths not every mounth. That would make some balance in matchmaking. Other problem is servers orrr host servers with 130 150 ping its totally normal ping thats really funny to watch when killer got 300 400 but game priority is killer so in his screen u can be near him and he hit you but if u are idk 5 10 m from him u anyway get hitted. Dedicates servers are really needed. In rate from 1 to 10 i can give this game 7 5\/10 facecamping problem no dedicates severs bags lags unfair ballance lots of but its high cuz gameplay is the most important think and that is why the rate is so high.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It is a fun casual yet competitive 1v4 survival horror game with 4 survivors and 1 killer trying to sacrifice them all. It's different from a lot of other online games which in many cases tend to be some kind of team FPS game this game is a refreshing change of pace. Survivors goal is to try to finish 5 generators to open the exit gates to escape from the killer. Meanwhile the killer is trying to find and chase down survivors to put them on a hook to sacrifice them to the Entity. There are a lot of killers and survivors now to choose from and the game is constantly being updated with new maps characters and DLC. What keeps me coming back to this game is the perks that both killers and survivors can get. The perks can drastically change the way how you play the game and always keep it fresh and interesting. You can play this game with friends as well if you like. If you are tired like me of playing the same worn over FPS shoot em' up games try this one it won't disappoint you.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

RIP TotalBiscuit you magnificent prick. While he s probably in a better place criticizing God s character model and the framerate of the pearly gates I m stuck down here only wishing I was dead by daylight. This game is 2 years old and I wonder to myself has the development team learned nothing from the failure of Evolve? Nothing at all? Really&gt Apparently not which like Evolve sucks for anyone who paid full price for this abortion. Could ve been a fun ride. Considering its only direct competition is Evolve or Depth it wasn t exactly a fair fight and the less said about Friday the 13th the better. The selection of killers seems robust the survivors seem equally capable. Interesting if predictable selection of DLC with everything on offer except Jason for obvious reasons. Matchmaking seemed reasonably quick comparative to eternal load times. The blood web felt counterintuitive. The weapon and customization options seemed somewhere between adequate and generous. Having to level up each killer \/ survivor independently feels cheap though not nearly as cheap as the design choice to favour 4 buffed up survivors over one completely sluggish Killer. The development team must be mentally ill. I don t appreciate having to pick a character pick a side and then commit to it. It s a far cry from a Left 4 Dead 2 killer although its certainly cheaper than Vermintide 2. As far as Online Only 4v1 Multiplayer games go this is #1. Terrible graphics. Input lag has cost me many kills I honestly believe I otherwise would ve made. Slow load times terrible match making and a complete lack of bots in this day and age is bloody inexcusable. I tried 4 different killers and 2 different survivors. Wasn t a fun experience. Hillbilly nurse and doctor seem to be the top 3 killers of choice. Still I find myself wondering why all of these minor balance issues still exist? I see missed potential. Like so many other games of this genre the developers are fine to pour on DLC like it s the last day on earth but they can t seemingly be bothered to fix simple gameplay issues. Again this game is 2 years old full of bugs and the community is as toxic as the game design is functionally broken. Pallet loop needs to be addressed. I don t care if it used to be good. It isn t anymore. You couldn t gift me this game because I d still refuse! Anyone who paid full price for this cancerous game deserves to be strung up on a meat hook and sacrificed to the entity.

{"date_posted":"2018-12-14","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":902,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Not Recommended","review":"So I used to love playing this game a while ago. I stopped playing for a little bit as I was getting to rank 1 pretty quickly and rank 1 is just no fun its only full of try hards. I came back after I saw the new chapter come out. I liked the idea of this new killer and I wanted to learn this killer playing this killer was okay I guess. I think I got 1 kill with them as I dont really know how to play them. I do like the mori tho best one by far. So far the killer is pretty cool I like them yet the perks could of been better tho. Same with the survivor but breakdown seems pretty cool if you are gonna be tunnled off the hook. Now that brings me to the next point I'm going to make. Tunneling is a main thing with this game also camping. I pretty much get tunneled all the time its even worse in the higher ranks. Its the only way killers know how to play it seems. Camping well you have ds on well most killers love to camp if you have that one perk. Now before many people comment on this and say what about toxic survivors dont worry I'm about to talk about them. Survivors yes they can be toxic. Survivors with flashlights if they know how to use them you bet they will blind you when ever they can. Yes I use a flshlight a lot but I only use them on killers that like to tunnel or camp but I mostly will use them to save people as thats what they are meant for. But dont get toxicness mixed up with good players. I know to some killers survivors that teabag or pointing can be seen as toxic and I can see why it is annoying when they just sit there doing that stuff. Now onto this new update that we have yes the killer and survivor are pretty cool and its nice to see this new change but a long with all this is so many bugs and I mean there is so many I have not seen this many bugs in one game this bad before like wtf happened to the game. Yes they have taken the new map down to fix it as people have been reporting that they have been crashing due to that one map and I'm glad to see they are trying to fix that but lets be honest now they won't fix it as they never fix things. They say they do but they never fix it right. Like the bug where you couldnt move at all many killers took advantage of that bug. They said they fixed it but it was never fixed took them over a month to fix that bug. I thought that was bad but these bugs we are getting now are even worse. Killers not been seen at all and getting hit from out of no where by a killer you cant see. Putting a pallet down and slidding around the map. Oh there is many more I can list too. But this review is all ready getting long enough. Now the new map? well I cant say much about it as I havent got to play on it just yet as I never got the chance to get it and they have taken it down so who knows when we will get it back so I can see how the new map is. So now I have said all the bad what about the good? Well I guess the only good thing anout this game is I've met some really great people on this game. Really good friends. So I guess this game is only good for playing with your friends or meeting new friends. KYF (Kill Your Friends) Is pretty good fun to just mess about with and have all the perks so you dont have to grind all the perks. So if you want to get this game make sure you have some friends to play with so you can play KYF. Now SWF is okay I guess if you want to play lobby simulator for an hour or until a killer isnt scared of a 4 or 3 man or even a 2 man yes killers will leave if there is even 2 SWF. So all around thoughts? Well I think I'm gonna be uninstalling until they can fix this game or do something with it. So go a head and buy this game if you want to try and find the game inside all these bugs. But what I would say is to not buy this game. I think it will only get worse then it already is. So \"pretty good job so far\" if I dont say so myself )","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

There two perspectives you will either play with in the game. The lone killer which the main objective is to is kill every survivor by hooking them onto a sacrificial hook while the \"entity\" slowly takes your offering and kills them. While the other perspective is the survivor which your job is to escape that killer by fixing generators and breaking the killers many totems around the maps. Both Killer\/Survivor has a giant perk tree that can sometimes give you items and sometimes gives you perks that helps you in the field. Do not mistake this game for a walk in a park because you will be suprised when that killer could be watching you from afar or even behind if your not aware of your surroundings. This game has given me hours of fun with friends and by myself. Gameplay varies with certain people who play the game. Some killers will kill you on sight some killers will play with there food some killers won't even chase you. It all depends. Always coming out with new content to keep you out on your toes. This game will give you a run for your money that is for certain.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Where do I start...lets start with the good things shall we? Wait... I dont think there are... oh wait! There are jumpscares! Those are fun right? I mean its fun to hear your friends scream into the microphone after the killer just appears in front of them out of nowhere or if they are being chasedLets move onto the bad things! Matchmaking isn't very good from what I've heard and experienced as both Killer and Survivor. Playing as the Killer is not so much fun since the survivors can troll and make fun of you for not being very good. How? Well they can pallet loop you (this mostly happens at lower rank killers higher ranks can counter this from what i've seen) they can open up the doors and wait for you to come just so they can tbag you or they can just camp in a locker somewhere on the map after the generators are done and gates are opened just to waste your time.The last few DLCs all cost money not even one free DLC. Besides this the new update arrived with a lot of microtransactions! Yay! You basically pay 5 euro for a pair of shorts when you can get a lot more customizations by buying a DLC instead of using the new currency in game. Along with this new update there had been some changes to The Shrine the perks cost a bit more than usual you seem to get shards a bit slower than normal (you get them by lvling up) and you get a lot less bloodpoints if you buy the perks you already had from the shrine. Most of the good and easy killers cost money of course there are a few free like Trapper which is pretty easy to learn or maybe the Wraith or Huntress...yeah those aren't easy... This is what I have to say for now about this game. It can still be a bit of fun here and there but I dont think it is worth 20 euro or 30 euro (if you want the digital deluxe edition which doesn't really gives you an advantage)If there is anything I missed if I did some mistakes or if I said something wrong please feel free to reply here just dont be hostile.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Game also provides purchasable DLCs for killers like Michael Myers (Halloween franchise) Freddy Krueger (ANOES franc) and Leatherface (Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise) a fact that really adds up to the fun of the game. The OST is also marvelous doesn't fall bahind and adds up the final touch to the thrilling experience..

And playing with friends makes it sooo much better.If you're looking to buy the game there are plenty of video tutorials out there for new players on YouTube. By watching the tutorials and regular gameplay videos I was able to get a better sense of how the game worked and how I needed\/wanted to play. There are many different styles of gameplay and not everyone plays exactly the same way with the same level of skill so this keeps the game dynamic and suspenseful. Yes you'll encounter some rotten apples in the game. And no not every match will go your way. But that goes for any online multiplayer game. You've just gotta brush 'em off and realize there are better people and games to come. But if you're triggered enough go ahead and be toxic your next game. Everybody's been there.

{"date_posted":"2016-08-28","funny":2,"helpful":1,"hour_played":2159,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Not Recommended","review":"It's really not a coincidence that more and more people are leaving the game and its pretty sad. Killers are at a \"balanced\" state among Rank 20's. Where even if they are bad at the game and are completely new to the game they can at least 3k in a game against other rank 20's. Now this is fine until you consider Rank 1 game play. Because killers have been slowly buffed over time and already skilled killers are getting the buffs it is really difficult to win a game as survivor. The 2 000 hours I have playing survivor doesn't change that. Get to a pallet and get hit with broken hit boxes with (enduring\/spirit fury\/both). Run for a window (bamboozle). Oh and by the way no more pallets or windows over here so might as well 360 (auto aim with M1). If that somehow works and I manage to anger the killer in any way shape or form then they will (lag switch\/camp\/tunnel\/all of the above). It's actually insane how far killers have gone in terms of power since 1.4 which was a time when survivors legitimately needed nerfs and now. And honestly like around 1.9 they finally had some balance between the 2 sides. However the devs were still on the nerf train to accommodate Rank 20's. This should have ended at 1.9 and instead should have been reworking the lower tier killers to be better because it was balanced at Rank 1. This is a time when survivors weren't op and skilled killers that got 4k's deserved them. But no the devs don't care about the current player base they only care about new people coming in to start playing. It's to the point where if you have any playtime over 100 hours then you can consistently 4k with ease. It really doesn't help that they manage to break the game more then they fix it with every update. The one thing they actually need to change is to (buff survivors\/nerf killers) and nerf gen speed or add a 2nd objective because that is the only way to have a chance at beating a killer is with the power of gen rush. If this would happen then the objective would take a little longer but survivors would be stronger so that if you are actually skilled at survivor then you have more of a chance to survive in a chase instead of the incredibly boring 20 second chases that the devs insist they want for the game. It wore fun for killer and survivor in my opinion especially without having the stress of all the gens being done in 3 minutes even with ruin. I say this just because holding M1 and pressing space occasionally is more boring then being chased. Adding a fair and not incredibly tedious 2nd objective then it would spice the game up and give time where you could potentially be chased in. Will this happen? Probably not. But hey maybe some day...","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Although there are some problems and glitches I reccomend getting this game as of how addicting and fun it is too play especially with friends.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I don't wanna play with asians in china because it is literally unplayable but half of the time it connects me don't know why. 300+ ping is dumb but ill give it a fair chance and stick with it for now. 1st match I played got down and the killer guy camped me until someone saved me by ignoring him. People who camp should get severly reduced xp to stop camping because I can see this being an issue. But so far so good I recommend it if you got money to spare because it is fun running away from a crazy guy.

But I wouldn't recommend this game for you because developers aren't doing anything with bugs unbalanced perks and add ons and even more things. If they do some update it is all about costumes or some new killer or surv or both. But repairing their game is too hard for them I think. Survivors are all about practice (but that's in every game that you have to practice) and teamwork but with this garbage community you have to play rather solo than with team. This game has really bad anti cheat. Killers are about perks and add ons (if you don't wanna play nurse that is hard and boring to play). Well you can play without perks and add ons but it will be a lot harder bcs not many players play this game so you will almost always play against good survs with good perks and items. But even if this game has so many problems I still like it but the devs should work with game and not doing updates that will give them some money. And the last thing is that you have to pay if you wanna play more killers or survs.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2017-10-28","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":1094,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Not Recommended","review":"A game of hide and seek where you cannot hideIn the light of recent events it's high time for me to give an honest and unbiased review of one of my favorite games in the library (which I don't always do). Just a sidenote I own this game for almost a year and played significant number of hours as a survivor main so I guess I can be a rightful critic.I regret to say that I DO NOT recommend this game because of 2 main reasons. The new killer is blatantly unbalanced and it's not me being a . I am pretty good at adapting to various unfavorable conditions like Bear Grills but Freddy goes far and beyond everything. His abilities cannot be countered in any way. He is completely invisible which makes The Wraith a mere joke. However you can spot his footsteps in the grass but let's be honest they are still barely visible and 90% of the cases you are busy with other stuff such as repairing the gens which are often located behind walls\/inside buildings. He can see you whenever you are outside of his terror radius if you are asleep which mocks the whole concept of stealth gameplay and hiding. Speaking of sleeping it is also hard to wake yourself up you either need a friend who will (oh my God) clap his hands like a cheerleader instead of giving you one big healthy slap OR failing a skillcheck. People do not often play SWF so finding a teammate can be tricky. Oh and btw you will probably have to go out of his terror radius to find one. Y'all know what happens next. Another way to wake up is to fail a skillcheck a gen or self healing works just right. Do I have to say that doing this will give away your position to a killer with a bright spotlight? You also fall asleep way too easy. Why don't make the killer focus some sort of a crosshair on a survivior for X seconds? Once in the dream world all you gotta do is pallet looping. Some salty killers expect you to sprint away ignoring any windows\/pallets because they suck at this game and mind gaming is a rocket science for them so pallet looping can also get you facecamped to death. Good job BHVR. As I said before you cannot counter his abilities. None of Laurie's perks seem to be working neither in reality nor in the dream world (according to the Reddit thread). TL DR you are hopeless. I gave this killer a benefit of the doubt and assumed that the problem is in me. But the overwhelming amount of negative feedback and other on literally every social platform kind of says that Freddy is OP not in a good way. You can even see the Steam notification on the product page saying that there are suspiciously a lot of reviews from 26th to 28th of October. The graph also shows a peak of negative feedback. Y'all connect the dots right? Another thing is absolute ignorance of the devs. Instead of fixing a whole lot of bugs they put their efforts into creating another P2W killer. One of the major issues seems to be a massive loss of progress. I personally experienced that 2 3 weeks ago (note that I've been playing DBD for a year) and STILL do not have my BP back regardless of the reports. My buddy lost his progress twice in a span of what...2 weeks? If this does not change WinRAR will be a much better purchase than this game.To sum it all up I think I would have to boycott the game until they nerf Freddy or publicly announce anything related to fixing him. It is fantastic how you can up the whole game set the community on fire and turn them against you without double checking the killer. Well done BHVR.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Makeing them collect serum instead of repairing is not fair at all. Those who came with this idea really hates survivors. ) Previous events were about repairing gens now you have to search for those nasty flowers while the killer just hooks you and gets serum immediately. Survivors must waste time interacting with that flower and it's like clensing a totem... Also killers can camp them easy.Not fair. Total imballanced gameplay. But it's so easy for killers to catch all survivors and there is also bloodpoints bonus. So survivors get ready to die alot and never escape during this event. )","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The changes that I've seen being made over the time I've played have been very good. The reponse from the devs and their streams every week show that they really care about the players. The player base however is full of salt. Both on Killer and Survival side. Only con I have is the DLC for the Clown is kinda meh I think they could have gone with better dynamics. The killer model is great looking though.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

But it gets old pretty fast when you get to the ranks where everyone knows what they are doing. It becomes a game about maximizing seconds and any mistake you make puts you further and further behind. Not to mention the chore that is acquiring blood points to get addons needed to hope to stand a chance. If you main killer I hope you are emotionally stable because your patience will be tested. If you saw a popular youtuber play this game and thought to yourself that it looks fun and you want to try it i assure you that will wear off and it will be one of the most frustrating multiplayer games in your library.

{"date_posted":"2018-05-15","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":82,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"Overall Rating 6.5\/10Dead by Daylight is an amazing concept and in certain circumstances the actual strength of that concept can shine through. However it suffers what many of the larger and more popular communities suffer from and that's a very toxic playerbase. The game rewards behaviors that can easily ruin the game for newer player and frustrate players of old. PROS Innovative Concept Allows for very enjoyable situations when paired with the right people. Balance This is iffy but I personally feel a lot of the character's strengths and weaknesses really play well together. Level Design Again this is inbetween but there are some levels that compliment the general concept really well. Movie References There is just something special about being chased by the man in the Kirk mask. Teamwork It's a game meant to be played in a cooperative spirit and the game feels like every decision you make can be weighed against your team's chance of surviving. CONS Toxic Playerbase Many campers trollers griefers and general unsportsmanlike behavior. Hitboxes These can be really iffy could be due to conncection(lag) but it feels like they are often just wrong. Seasons The rank is reset every 'season' which leads to high ranks ending up back with newbies it turns into a massacre for a good week or two after. Lag There are no professionally hosted servers everything is hosted by the killer which leads to insane bouts of lag and connection jitter. Glitches Things such as ending up on the wrong side of the pallet or losing items due to connection dropping. Camping Yes it's so bad it warrants its own con. You will get camped and you will lose points\/items\/pips as a result of it. Rage Quitters These people will wreck your games when you encounter them. The game works on a basis of 4 people 5 generators. If someone leaves midgame you don't lose a required generator as you would if they disconnected while loading. So you get stuck with three or even two people stuck having to do five generators by themselves. So I know there are a lot of cons and some of them have ruined many other games. But despite those cons I still feel like the game is fun every now and again. Yes there are matches that are ruined by the community yes there are people that disconnect (rage quit) and kill your chances of survival. But I think it's a good game to pickup especially if you have a solid group of friends to play it with. This isn't really a game to play alone it's definitely a game that's better with a group of friends.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It is frustating as hell.

They will run in circles arround them. When you finaly catch them survivors will have half of their objective completed but that is not all you have to hook them and it takes long time before they die. So you have to go away (if dont want loose the match) and see how you have to chase them another two times. Perks and addons are unbalanced.

Is the game worth it? yes the game gets many negative reviews for no reason imo. How can someone that wasted over 1k hours into something go out of their way to say ' this game this game is and not worth it' (15 mins later he's already playing the game he was calling garbage) You'll have lots of fun playing this torture sim. First experience as a survivor (That's how I felt while playing the game of course you may think differently) At first while playing as a survivor you'll be in' your pants just be hearing a heartbeat. Your first couple of hours will be tense as and you'll most likely feel like the killer is way too overpowered and is just a powerhouse that can't be topped. With time you'll learn how to play around the killer and your fear will go away unfortunately. The game is also amazing to play with friends it's one of those games you'll have lots of fun playing with your buddies and I'm pretty sure that if you have a party of 2 3 friends to play with you guys will have a blast! First experience as a killer My experience as a killer I could say was mixed feelings I had loads of fun and I was frustrated at some points. (Mostly because I was bad and kept losing people constantly) but with time and by getting experience with the game I started to have loads of fun (And I wouldn't be scared because of no hideous monster that was trying to sacrifice me to some entity) so getting to the point playing killer requires a bit of time to get used to but it's what I enjoy playing the most and have loads of fun doing so. Community You'll find all sorts of people in game such as Ochido wannabe Does not like gens Likes pressing ctrl a lot Is always looking to annoy you somehow and loop you all game usually ragequits. And you'll eventually come across the 'god like survivor' These ones I have a lot of respect for Likes gens you don't want them to do Knows how to mindgame you Actually knows how to hide Doesn't only loop like a mongoloid and thinks he's good (looping isn't an issue everything can be 'countered' to some extent) As a survivor you'll find some really interesting creatures of the night such as Insidious Leatherface Likes corners a lot Is usually eating while playing with his foot gets easy 4k's (makes me proud for knowing how to use his 'skills') The salty guy Doesn't like when survivors use decisive strke if is looped once will probably rage quit if you window juke him he'll punch his mum if you get caught you're getting face camped. (Please don't complain about being facecamped just accept and move forward) The cummunity isn't as good as I hoped. Many complain about every single change the game makes which I think it's a bit stupid. The game will have lots of people complaining for every single new killer that is released they'll complain basically for any reason they can find. If you guys care about the future of the game don't be afraid of changes embrace them! About balance issues 90% of the disscussion section complain about the game being survivor\/killer sided and I'm not gonna address this in this review. But all I'm going to say is the game surely isn't 100% perfect but it's not like every single game you'll face a really good swf group. Final thoughts 11\/10I feel for anyone that lost their precious time reading to this useless review buy this game now and it comes with extra salt!

But there's a few HUGE problems with it that the developers need to fix.Main problem KILLERS CAMPING.I've lost ranks so many times because of this. The killer will hang you up and just stand there and none of the other survivors can do anything to save you. This needs to be stopped. At least come up with a system where the killers lose points if they camp. It makes the gameplay a lot less entertaining when you're being camped 95% of the time. And sadly that's around the right percentage of camper killers. I come across them in almost every game.Here's another problem the killer is way too fast. Maybe slow him down a bit? Also fix the glitch where he can hit you through windows. I've gotten caught countless times this way. One more thing chainsaw guy is way too overpowered I've never won against him but have won a ton of times against other killers. Other than these problems I love the game. Hope the developers can do something about some of these things. Please stop the killers camping. It's getting really old.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It is a fun game but no where near the thrill and excitment that Friday the 13 has so in my opinion if your looking to get a game like this get friday the 13th its scarier way harder and overall more fun. this game is really fast paste and there is only one way to get out which makes it very repetitve while friday the 13th has mulitple diffrent senrious.

My review would've been more positive if this was early access.The games core idea is great it's like someone had an idea for a best selling novel but then asked a 5th grader to write it. The whole game just seems so poorly executed.Bugs still litter the game even though it was released in June. I've gotten stuck in a wall warped through the map was able to farm a hook that wouldn't be sabotaged among other things. The bigges of which was my skill check bar was slightly off in every single game the UI was actually a earlier in the circle and ended sooner than it indicated.The matchmaking is something else that has issues. I downloaded the game and tried out survivors. 1 out of 2 games I was vs a max level killer with full perks. Other times just close to max level. That could be an issue with the amount of people playing the game. So unforunately not easy solution for the devs.Anywho if this is cheap maybe pick it up. They have been patching fairly consistently. Maybe it'll be nice and stable by the xmas sale.PS Games are hosted by the killer.....if they have a connection....gl","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

This might be the most glitched non working game at times... That being said let's talk about the game play.... By which I mean if you're a survivor be prepared when you do get caught to be hung on a hook and camped until you die. Not a single killer in this game plays the game correctly they just camp you ont he hook until you die. Or you get the killers who use cheats and see where EVERYONE is at all times and i do mean EVERYONE. Lastly not having dedicated servers and letting the killer be host lets the killer CHEAT AS MUCH AS THEY WANT. This game would be fun if they made it so killers cant camp if killers wernt the host so they can use cheats and if killers didnt camp and cheat. I have yet to see a game where the survivors win at all because moment survivor is caught its camp time everytime every killer. Hopefully when Friday 13th comes out next year they fix everything wrong about this game. P.S. if i had paid money for this game legit i would take this company to court for my money back with all the bugs\/glitches\/cheaters\/camping.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Soon later I picked the game up again and the difference is unbelievable. It's incredibly fun to play with your friends or to play competitively solo or in a lobby. The new maps and killers have really added a different feel to the game and it's all around mechanics are largely improved. The developers seem to be taking the games need for progression very seriously which has saw them release both visual updates to change up the game and allow more personal customization as well as updates to constantly fix any bugs or glitches that are hurting the game Along with the huge improvement of the server quality it is an all around great game. I'd definitely recommend the game to anybody into the high intensity survival horror thrill genre of games.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Killers may be a tad under powered against a decent teamAlso a good idea would to add a ingame point boost that you could buy with funds from your steam wallet that would be great.Another good idea would be to allow players to reset their blood point tree at the cost of some points of course.I am writing this review in hopes that the devolper will hear the public outcry of some of the issues in the game and work with the community to fix them.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I've changed my opinion back to a recommendation for this game as new updates that have been released have fixed most if not all of the major exploits that ruined the game in certain matches.I feel it's quite rare that a game dev can listen to it's community as well as these guys have but the dev team here have clearly worked hard in order to ensure their game is balanced and that their player base is happy with their product. Top job guys!The game itself has a wonderfully dark atmosphere to it and the variety of playable killers map layouts and minor game changers in the form of \"offerings\" really keeps this game fresh and enjoyable. I cannot recall a multiplayer game prior to Dead by Daylight that has had my heart racing as I near my objective goal with all other survivors slowly being picked off and the killer nowhere to be seen in the fog. The chases you can end up in are genuinely tense so if you're after a thrilling multiplayer horror experience this is it.Minor complaints I'd like to make is that it can feel a tad repeptitive at times (please take that with a pinch of salt since over 100 hrs of play is bound to feel repetitive). A few more creative ways to sacrifice survivors instead of just using a meathook exclusively could be a novelty. And trying to get into a lobby as a survivor can be a lengthy process at times the game could benefit from a lobby list showing the lobby's ping this would stop the need of people to test their ping in the chatbox and instantly leaving if they're unsatysfied with the timing.Overall I am madly in love with this game and I cannot keep away from it. It's really nice to change my previous 'Not Recommended' to a 'Recommended' status as this is a very unique and fun game that deserves to be played.

It was a shame that payday 2 released so much dlc that it went double the price of what it was just by dlcs alone.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The game is good there are a few things that need to be fixed for example...Long laoding screens when joining games joining a game then crashing and after a game you can't proceed to do a next round without starting at step 1...A part from that it's all good. People need to expect bugs and glitches not every game is perfect after all these games can take up to years of work. The character customization is amazing (Not sure why every character is refeering to left 4 dead 1\/2 though). Enjoy don't be fooled by all the people complaing about bugs I nearly did and I would of missed out on this great game expeiance.

If you're reading this review and haven't purchased the game CONGRATULATIONS THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR YOU...AND YOUR MONEY!! Next thing for you to do is find another title to buy with the cash you just saved! Seriously though this game is pretty fun even if it does get a bit repetitive. That being said it is COMPLETELY BROKEN and ISN\"T BEING FIXED!!! The developers have finally responded to the community which is nice but we keep seeing additional DLC without the major issue of NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME MOST OF THE TIME being resolved! They updated it just prior to me discontinuing play. I quit because after the update the game was more broken for me than it was before. Survive with friends was fairly stable until the patch then it became difficult to play at all as a survivor. Also I experience freezing after the patch that wasn't occuring before. It is just a major pain to pay money and to like the game when you can't get it to work to have all these issues and them not be fixed for so long now. I would suggest finding another game or 10 to play. If you start hearing DBD is fixed then maybe purchase it as it really is a fun game at least for a while.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Me and a friend bought this game and started playing it together yesterday. I have played about 10 games summing up to almost 3 hours of.+Its a lot of fun.+It's original. Its VERY unbalanced I played 10 games managed to escape 0. Killer always gets 10k+ points I get between 3k 7k depending on. There is no counterplay you can run all you want but 7\/10 times the killer catch up to you. Doesn't matter if you wiggle there's hooks literally everywhere making it impossible to break free. Beginners is being matched up with experienced players with 100+ hours of game time. THE CHAINSAW. which strikes you once and you're done. Unless you have 5 friends who own the game you can't play as killer with friends. As the game is now I would not recommend anyone buying in. It's way too unbalanced game favors the killer even if you get all the generators running it takes forever to open the door to escape you get matched up with way too overpowered players due to their perks and experience which you don't have and can't catch up to since you won't earn any points due to the fact that you basically can't win.UPDATE So I have been playing killer lately.It is not fun. I'm actually a decent killer do this is not just sad complains from a scrublord. Survivors can loop you as much as the want if you kick a pallet they shine the almighty flashlight in your eyes which you are too stupid to turn your eyes away from(devs please) the t bag banter and are obnoxious. They are like little rats running around always missing the traps and still get the cheese. I want to stomp them. Well I do however win 9\/10 of my killer games so I can't really be that mad or can I?","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Who doesnt want to be a killer from old movies we use to watch as kids? However still some things i would change\/improve upon.Gameplay BUG! Have any sort of special characters in your name will reset your survivors\/killers levels but not your rank. Beware (had to start off at lvl 1 all over again) Was hoping for more than one type of game mode (instead of just grab generators and run like hell) Maybe introduce other game modes or different twists. Would love to be stuck inside a haunted house with one of these creeps. Vaulting is to op sometimes this coming from a survivor player some instance of the maps where you can just vault over and over again to keep away from the killer is sometimes a bit op. There was one instance with 3 windows all next to eachother and no way for the killer to touch you. Survior co op play this has been said so many time I think I dont need to state it once again. Map generation is another thing winning a match is based on how lucky your generators spawns are Ive seen maps where 4 generators all next to each other making it impossible to get with a killer able to cover all 4 at once.Ranking For a game about survival and escape you loose rank if you escape to fast seems to be more based on \"grinding\/farming\" that actual escaping and surviving to rank up As a killer if a survior disconnects\/rage quits after you capture\/hook\/pretty much anything you loose those points you should have gained thus loosing rank\/blood.Matchmaking Notice alot of bugs when it comes to match making either having to relog or spamming join lobby to get into a match Needs to be some sort of matchmaking based off level\/rank. Having a lvl 30 hunter and 4 lvl 5 surviors with no perks doesnt make for a very fair match.These are just my random thoughts.

I've been looking forward to playing this game after hearing so much about it and this free weekend seemed like the perfect excuse to finally try it out. But it seems not everything is always as it first appears to be. (That's why you should never pre order as well.)Negative Peer to peer hosting. No dedicated servers. The Killer hosts and the survivors try to fight another horror Lagg.Boring repetitive gameplay. You find generators fix them with occasional QTE and avoid the killer.Random skillchecks for fixing stuff healing people and probably other stuff as well that I haven't found out yet.Pretty much just cat and mouse gameplay. You hide go do something hide again or get caught.terrible UI It feels off and just doesn't really give you a good indication of what everything is about. You have to figure everything out yourself and even then you usually don't get any idea of what is really happening.The matchmaking Usually as a low lvl char you get matched up against people with rare to ultra rare perks who know what to do. Hook camping.Really... this one is just annoying as hell. Killers just stand in front of you while you slowly die. No way for your team mates to come and help you out. It's just a slow and painfull death.Character perks seem to be randomly generated and you can't build out a skill tree. You have to get everything in your tree to lvl up and get a new randomly generated perk tree for this specific character.The game doesn't explain much. Just the basics of survival. Everything listed below you get to figure out by struggling.There's icons appearing at the beginning of the match. What do they mean? What do you do with them? I wouldn't know cause the game doesn't even give you the time to read everything if you hover over it. You just get tossed into a loading screen and you just have to figure out yourself what the hell those icons were about.When you're alone you have to look for a hatch but it's never explained how. You just have to find it somehow or fix even more generators for your daring escape.No explanation on how to sabotage hooks and other things.Positive The bloodweb flavor text is interesting and makes for a good read.It's got a nice setting and the maps are interesting to navigate.Interesting concept of a game but very badly executed.Conclusion My initial enthousiasm did fade quite quickly as the game is tremendously flawed and actually pretty boring after a while. Even with friends I had a feeling it was a massive grindfest after just a game or 2. Despite having fun just messing around with eath other and the game it just didn't live up to the expectations. It felt a lot like Evolve had a baby with a horror game and dumbed everything down even more. It's the same boring grind the same boring matchmaking experience and just genrally badly optimised. The game doesn't feel like it's complete yet.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

You'll hear the heart of your character beating but what you'll realize and it'll impress you is that yours beats even stronger because of the fear of being caught by the killer.While the game is quite repetitive (little amount of maps and game modes) it is very entertaining and you will definitely have a good time.The only thing that I find awful and that the developers should fix is the matchmaking as it is very uneven. If you're a newbie the chances where you have some games with very specialized players with many hours of games are likely 98% of the times which will make you feel that the game is unfair. If you are a novice survivor and you are always killed or a rookie killer and every survivor escapes don't be disappointed and keep practicing!

It looked fun maybe even challenging. But then I started playing the game myself.This game honestly is hardly even fun.Playing as the killer is a complete waste of time the odds are stacked so hard against you you almost want to just afk. Be a rank 20 killer and 3 lobbies in a row have ranks 2 4 survivors with all sorts of ultra rare perks speed boosts fast healing etc. How do you expect me as a rank 20 killer with no perks to hit someone 2 times while they move double my speed and heal themselves before i can catch them. Be a survivor. Unless you know the endless loops in the game to just aggravate the killer and ruin the game for all those in it its really not worth it. It is far too easy to play as a survivor especially when you have people that know these loops.Overall the game is maybe 3\/10. Until they update and balance the killers its not even worth the money. This isn't even to mention that there is no party queuing system. This just put the cherry on top.

If a Killer d\/c's then he keeps whatever points he earned if he sacrificed any Survivors and wins by default. Have to ACTUALLY click \"unready\"\/\"ready\" to get Survivors to join! Survivors join then either leave looking for friends or get D\/C sometimes at the last second making it 3 v 1 . Survivors can just pull debris in front of killer or jump through windows that NOT ONLY slow you down but make the camera get locked looking upwards too long for you to regain movement.

There's a cheap thrill in being chased around by someone that you can't actually kill and can only really escape from but winning as the survivors seems almost impossible against a semi competent killer. It's a nifty concept for a game but there's just not enough too it and the progression system is overly convoluted.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Each map and killer is very balanced and make sure that the game is neither too hard or too easy. My only complaint for the game is how badly the flashlight needs to be buffed. I've tried so many time to blind the killer with it but it always ends with me on hook. Its practically garbage and makes me want to have anything but it.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},
{"date_posted":"2016-06-17","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":28,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"First off I'd like to say I love \"Dead by Daylight\" so far. I've currently invested 13 hours total into it and the concept was exactly what I was looking for. I have my complaints but none of them will stop me from playing this game. So I guess I'll get into them As you now know I have enjoyed almost everything the game offers. But what I don't enjoy is waiting for people to stop lobby hopping to find their friends. When you quick join as a survivor it's not so bad but when you start a server... ugh. Basically it seems like the game sends people to your lobby in waves. The first one hits and it's usually comprised of said lobby hoppers. The second wave hits and you may get some players who \"claim\" to be ready. After the third wave you've either lost all but one or some other scenario that usually ends the same way. So you wait until that one person leaves and then you back out. After this you boot up a lobby again and go through the whole circuit once more. The second time usually seems to be the charm for me though. But don't let that information discourage you from buying the game this is the worst case scenario I've found and doesn't happen every time you start a lobby. As previously mentioned I've heard that the reason for this situation is because people are trying to find their friends and leave a game when it's not the correct one. Though I don't know how you would create it a party system would benefit those (like me) who don't care about who we play with. This system would also help the lobby hoppers (of course) as they could find their friends in a much easier way. Remember if you're reading this and you know you're a lobby hopper please refrain from it! It's not enjoyable for those of us on the receiving end.My second complaint is with the \"Wraith\" killer. Unfortunately I have found him to be extremely unfair and unbalanced. His invisibility power does not seem to have much of a cooldown and does not take as long to de activate as it should. If the amount of time the de activation took were longer and stalled the killer survivors would have a moment of grace to react as they see fit. As of the time of this writing almost every match I've joined has ended with me dying purely because the Wraith is the most popular character. I have only escaped once from the Wraith and it was not an enjoyable experience. It seems as though the Wraith is the character the cheaters tend to use as their playing style is always the same We'd start the map and the first thing we'd hear is the sound of bells which indicates that the Wraith has gone invisible. This appears to be the pattern for the rest of the match. After crawling around for fear of a surprise attack we'd finally work up the courage to start a generator. If we're lucky we can sometimes fix it a quarter of the way before our hearts start beating or we fumble on the skill check. This is where it gets cheap. After running around a little I'd join another survivor in fixing a different generator. We'd stay there for a little while until all of a sudden the Wraith appears behind me out of nowhere and strikes. With any other killer this would be thrilling as if it was punishment for foolishly sticking around too long. But with no warning from the Wraith it just feels unfair. Once he's put you on a meat hook the person playing as the Wraith begins to camp around you using his invisibility to catch anyone who thinks he's gone. This behavior is less like a murderer and more like an unjust bully. While I love this game the Wraith almost always convinces me to just play as a killer instead. I have only played as the Wraith once and absolutely refused to use his invisibility power. Upon testing this I found that the Wraith really has no advantage otherwise and can only really win when his cheating ability is used. I am not cutting down the people who created this character and his abilities I am merely trying to point out the way that players are wrongfully using him. It is because of this that I truly believe this game would benefit greatly should the Wraith be removed. At the least that his powers be lessened to an enjoyable state.My third and final complaint is directed to certain people playing as survivors. On rare occasions I have run into players as the trapper and tried to subdue them accordingly. Unfortunately specific cheaters have found a way to evade the killer in a manner that is quite irritating. first they slide through a window. Then they wait until you're at the halfway point before sliding through again back to the side they started on. While this may seem like a smart tactic at first they take it too far. This annoying dance continues back and forth as they know you can't catch them. There really isn't a way to stop this as they run away when I try to put a trap down. This is the only time where I would use the Wraith's ability as I am not a fan of such cheap tactics.Final note I just wanted to finish by saying I really enjoy playing as Meg and the Trapper the latter whom I find the most fun killer to play. I think both these characters perfectly fit the atmosphere with the Trapper's clunky Jason Voorhees style really hitting the mark for me. Overall I'd say this game is most definitely worth it just hope that you don't end up stuck with the Wraith.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Add to that the fact that you are plunged into the game without any sort of tutorial to show you how the game works (there are videos which are a little helpful but it doesn't show you anything useful in terms of gameplay what buttons to press etc)... It's not very intuitive to play either when you find something in a chest the game doesn't tell you what it is you have to work that out for yourself..

But it is boring and linear to no end. There is no fun in it. As survivors you only have to fix generators and escape the area. That's it. That's your only goal. And as the monster you have to kill the survivors. I appreciate the original idea but it is not ambitious enough. There are a number of survivors and different monsters with different abilities and it is kind of balanced. But there is something about this game that prevented me from continuing to play after only one hour. I prefer to go back to Left 4 Dead 2 versus mode which is way more fun than this and by surviving you feel you actually did something. Overall I don't recommend this game because it is just not fun enough.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It can be so good and has so much potential. But the fact that you aren't able to party up into a quick match is honestly ing stupid. The developers complain about stat padding. But really not many give a about stat padding. This isn't going to be a game played at a pro level. The fact that the developers decided to leave the party system out because of \"Stat Fudging\" really hurts this game. It's fun for a while on your own but falls short when you want to play with your friends. If you are really afraid of stat fudging then make the xp gained by a party halved or quartered depending on how many people queue up together. I would not suggest this game if you are looking for something fun and different to play with friends. I wouldn't suggest paying full price for the game either because of the lack of party support.

He began to limp away to the cornfield in a desperate attempt to break line of sight. But I was ready for this special friend of mine for the field was littered in traps. In not too long I heard the most rewarding SNAP of a beartrap and came over to find him knees down in an upgraded trap. Hoisted him up on my shoulder and brought him to the top of the tractor not the hooks the tractor. Why? I had something special planned. And that specialty was a Memento Mori with his name on it. Dropped him on the tractor and let him crawl around for a bit basking in the glory of catching this slippery .

PSA Got this game for free from a friend.I'm not going to sugarcoat this review talking about what the game manages to do well. Watch any twitch stream or youtube video and you can see that the game only aims to succeed at its most core elements which is 1 killer 4 survivors 5 generators try to escape. Despite the lack of variety it's very fun.The matchmaking however is terrible and ruins an otherwise really fun game. Not only will the game not automatically put me back into queue after it \"fails to find a lobby\" 2 seconds after I click to join but it will also not put me back into queue when a lobby falls out or a lobby couldn't be found(note this is a different error than failing to find a lobby). I have to keep reclicking Join after anywhere from 2 to 200 seconds of sitting there waiting. And 75% of the lobbies I find fall apart. 90% of the games I played my first day just dropped randomly before we could finish. I guess the killer left the game. I don't know.And there's bots\/point farmers too. It's really obnoxious. I can't sit down and enjoy myself when I wait 5 10minutes queueing for this game only to feel unsatisfied when my games stop short or the game just ends up being really for me for any number of reasons. Hard to justify dumping my time and patience into this. If the matchmaking weren't bad I can put up with the occasional game where I get chased down by the killer from the get go and nobody comes to save me so I die in like a minute or two(I'm not very good yet). It's part of the game. Whatever. But that's a risk I have to consider every time I invest my time into trying to find any game at all.I will recommend it because if you play with friends and not by yourself I imagine it's still worth playing and I will probably end up doing that instead of trying to play solo but I'm also hopeful that it will be worth playing in the future once these issues are fixed.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Definitely not for casual players. because It's time consuming (I have over 500h and still don't have all achievs\/characters) It's not newbie friendly. People are being butchered in first 100h of their gameplay Bugs (what game that is constantly changing does not have them) Kinda toxic community (always complaining about something) You may have really long waiting time to get into game (they are working on it)It's not only negatives Fun to play (once you understand the game) Play with your friends (that is really strong factor in this game) Leveling is well made and now you don't need to level up everything. Use Shrine of Secrets to get you new teachable perks. \/ Also level grinding is going to be smaller. Free DLC (what game gives you that) Huge community (salty most of time but you get all help you need) Developers and mods are communicating with players!Also dont forget there are developers that make every week a hour long stream about what is going on!! Thats huge plus in my opinion.#################################################################old review (negative) When I get this game I was curious about the hate this game already has.Couple of games HOOKED me (yea.) and I just keep playing.Sadly now after 100+ hours i am kinda There is so many glitches and actually few exploits that makes this game unbearable.Rank up system is a joke. There is no point in escaping unless you did less job then the other survivors and you need that sweet 5k for escaping.Also killer doesn't need to kill anyone. He can just run around them and do nothing and he will still rank up.But don't take too bad impression from this. It's fun as long as you take it as a game.Developers are actually listening to people about glitches\/bugs\/hackers and trying to remove it but in the current state its game full of bugs.Once its all fixed matchmaking balanced. Super idiotic dev ideas removed\/reworked. Then and only then ill give it a recommendation.Also don't forget that there are no key bindings option or advanced video options.21th July 2016","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

With killer the only real differnce is the special ability which will nice doesn't greatly impact gameplay.The matchmaking of this game is horrible. It'll put brand new players with the lowest possible rank up against full teams of rank 15+ or up against random spreads of a few low ranks and then one increadibly high rank player. I've seen games with a rank 19 killer two rank 19 survivors 1 rank 14 and 1 rank 8.Not only is the matchmaking toxic but the community as a whole can be as well. You'll get teams of 3 or 4 who will refuse to actually work towards the survivors goal until they've farmed everything AND everyone on the team is healthy. Who will body block you and taunt you when try to do anything and equip themselves with the BEST flashlights possible and then the second you try to do ANYTHING will take the first possible opportunity to shine said flashlight in your face. And then mock you in chat for not being able to do anything.TL DR If you like toxic communities or have friends to play this with go for it. Otherwise skip it.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Definitely one of those \"Just one more\" kind of games. There's also the capability of playing with up to 3 friends (4 if you want to host a lobby forfeiting progress on your characters) meaning there's all kinds of fun to be had with a group. One of the nicest parts of this semi competitive game is that if you become sick of being shafted by the other side... Just switch sides!

If you want the best experience in this game play both roles. Do not develop an opinion on this game until you have at least 25 hours in each because you won't know the true hardships of either until you do.

As has happened only a few other times in my life as soon as I saw the game being played I knew that I would enjoy it. What I saw was a masterwork of game design distilling everything I liked about the old Evolve experience into a game that didn't also want to be a shooter. What I saw was a perfectly balanced game of cats and mice. What I saw was something I expected to spend thousands of hours playing with my friends over the coming months.I could not have been more wrong or more disappointed.In my illustrious 42 minute career I was the Killer three times. In the first round I successfully \"downed\" my opponents three times and all three times I was too far away from a hook to actually kill them. In the second round I did not see a single enemy even while watching the exit. In the third round the players actively exploited me to get as much experience as possible eventually dancing within the safety of the exit. One probably out of sympathy briefly hopped out of the exit to let me get a single hit in before escaping.One of Evolve's greatest strengths was its rich soundscape. In this game on the other hand the soundscape is actively deceitful. Your own footsteps and grass rustles drift behind you and the only noises I heard my opponents make were healthkits and barricade drops. The upshot? The instant my enemy was no longer onscreen they were safe. Often I would surprise them around a corner successfully marshaling my Evolve instincts to \"head them off\" but they always saw me and walked away before I could hit them with my stubby little arms.The strangest thing is that the game I just played looked like it was months of concentrated development effort behind the game I saw in the videos earlier today. What happened?P.S. This will be the first game I ever refund on Steam.P.P.S. Now I know how the pubbies who hated the old Evolve felt.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I've reviewed the game with a silly phrase and i'm editing the review cause i got the hours to back it up what I WANT TO SAY....This game is fantastic(don't mind the silly rage quit kids) for 20 bucks you got a great game where you have the option to play both sides survivor\/killer....In 3rd vision\/1st vision.....in 6 maps generated in 5 diferent ways(20 bucks)....You got 5 survivors and 4 Killers (another one is coming) with clothes to personalize.....(20 bucks)with 5 modes to play.....Kill your friends Survive with friends Survivor mode Killer mode and quick mode.Generated skill tree where you can combine 4 diferent slots of Itens Add ons Offering and Perks to create multiple play styles....(20 bucks).Really???What's the catch?Well the catch is that the game suffers from constant pressure of silly kids who take things a little too serious while playing.....there's been bugs of rendering and some minor aspects of loading parts of maps players get stuck under some rocks and and stuff and i dont get cause i never had any of this things in the amount of hours i had...they had over 30 bug fixes 3 days after release and people complained....They created survive with friends at people demands in 4 weeks and they complained Infinite loop jukes got cried out they fixed a lot and people complained(20 fk bucks).Well i know the game is not perfect none really are the matchmaking is annoying for people from what i've heard(never waited more then 2 minutes for each game Ever) the dc's and lack of punishment for both sides the hilarious part of lack of content(20 fk bucks and peope still cry) the camping part of the killers Key binding what's the rest cause i don't remember......Still better than the salt people are throwing at the game....","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

One of the biggest problems I've seen in this game is that sometimes the killer will not kill survivors but rather befriend them and boost points with them. There should be a way to report this behavior.And honestly if you're a survivor and you boost with the killer you're a nerd who cares more about your rank and points than you do about playing the game right.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Dead by daylight is a 1 vs 4 killer vs survivors multiplayer only game. It does a good job of balancing the 2 sides at low level ranked play. The music is good and the atmosphere is creepy. If halloween is close by I'd recommend playing. There are quite a few killers with unique perks the survivors however are mostly similiar. Tension is what this game does best mostly from the survivor side. Turning around while working on a generator to see Michael Myers staring at you is as creepy as it gets.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Survivor some how gains speed while limping and bleeding out of their so it's impossible to catch them. If there aren't any hooks within 30m from your position your survivor gets away. When survivor gets away you are stunned for far too long and your fast moving limping survivor already has you beat. Your abilities are Each killer's ability is beyond . Bear traps that you have to be literally in the center of an invis that isn't invis if the survivor has his screen brightness up at all.

It's suppose to be hard otherwise what's the fun in playing?I'd much prefer the designers work on more important things like finding matches than worrying about making people happy by nerfing a killer or survivor.It's simple find a gaming style that works on the killer\/survivor you're up against.

Suddenly one of the other survivors came RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME DESPITE ME HITTING THEM WITH A ******* HUGE *** MACHETE TOOK DOWN THAT VICTIM. After that I chased the person I hit and put them on the hook. Right after that the very same person I had impaled on a meathook before TOOK A MACHETE TO THE ******* FACE AND TOOK DOWN THE GUY ON THE HOOK. ARE YOU ******* KIDDING ME??I liked this game when the atmosphere was scary. Now its just a joke game a game with no elements that make you think that I dont know but maybe IN A HORROR MOVIE? This is the entire point of this game to feel like a horror movie but right now it is a damned disgrace to the genre. When I saw this game I imagined a scary game a game where it feels like you are fighting for your life and running away from a brutal serial killer.Now when I think about it I think of a game of \"Monkey in the Middle\" where the \"survivors\" bully the serial killer and make HIM feel scared of being infinite window juked or constantly denied kills in goofy ways. How scary would Friday the 13th be if the main characters ran circles around Jason and window hopped constantly. How scary would Scream be if you saw that one of the characters just played Benny Hill with the killer and had the sole goal of wasting their time?If you are a person wanting to play a horror movie as a game dont buy this. Right now this game is just as scary as the Benny Hill theme. Spooks you doesnt it?","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Kill your friends when you actually have enough friends who don't crash every game is really fun but when we want to have a random killer and\/or its just me and another friend the survive with friends match making is just... its awful. There is so many lobby dodges from killers and when we finally get into a game it either crashes for me or them or the killer isn't even a good killer.Being a killer match making runs better but I can't play it well because sometimes my internet likes to be a butt.This game is too glitchy crashes too much match making is awful and it takes forever to find a match especially with survive with friends. But it is a fun game when it works right. It isn't really worth the 20 dollars but if you want to sit for 15 20min every time you want to join a lobby risk crashing when you finally get a match experience lag ingame due to the killers internet and\/pr risk getting a noob killer who either camps or just plays the game so wrong then yeah the game is pretty fun would reccomend.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

We'll all take flashlights except 1 person who might take a tool box and while they're fixing generators we'll troll the living day lights out of the killer. When playing alone it does get that very creepy feel especially when you hear the terror radius heart beat very suddenly when you're about to finish repairing a generator. Do you finish it? Do you run? Overall though it's fun but it varies from game to game depending on who you play with.I've had a couple very frustrating games when either my team mates don't help other's get off hooks and when the killer just face camps.

HE FREE HIM AND THE TRAP DOESNT GET SET OFF now dont get me wrong i love this game and cant wait to see what gets added in but if something isnt changed with these machanics then no one can play because theres no point being a killer if u cant kill i hope this gets to you guys because i want to be able to play this and not waste 18 bucks id be happy if u could just step over stuff faster or break barricades quicker. love what youve made but it infuriates me to see a good game have cheap mechanics besides even if i did want a refund i couldnt because ive played for ten hours besides that and my ranting keep up the good work.would reccomend","title":"Dead by Daylight"},
{"date_posted":"2016-06-20","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":102,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"Probably the best multiplayer horror game I've played. Music details dark mist crows surroundings made of damaged and abandoned things and buildings everything works perfectly to create an immense and scary atmosphere in which you are supposed to survive \/ hunt others. The goals are quite simple yet are difficult to achieve. Overall gameplay is pretty good but it is true that the survivors have more chances to escape the killer who is faster then them but cannot jump through windows or other obstacles and if the survivors are cooperating enough it can be very frustrating game for the hunter. However whichever role you play it depends on your SKILLS not on some flashlights traps bells medkits and other things mentioned in many reviews. This game was made for mature audience not for children who and it is understandable sometimes cannot understand the true potential of this excellent game and are angry because they cannot win. It is true that there are some bugs and lags here or there but it occurs in around 1 in 10 games so it is not so bad. Many people complain about the matchmaking meaning you can play with 5 friends or with none of them (no duo trio is accepted in this game). But it has its point the game stands on the idea that four people find themselves on some place and only their fear and feeling for survival connects them. Would it be fun if 3 of these survivors were sky.pe friends and tell each other where is the killer where are the traps and whether or not repair this generator? I think not the game would lose all of its magic. So please understand this and enjoy the fear not your drinking buddy on the other side of team.speak.Nevertheless you are playing with real people against real people therefore the gameplay is much more scary and realistic than in majority of others.The cons (small bugs survivor buff\") are so tiny that it do absolutely do not ruin my impressions from this game. If you do like fear and horror atmosphere buy this game you will not regret it it contains everything you need to play it until daylight!9 5\/10","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

My game crashed quite a bit within the last month or so and also lost all my progress but emailed the DBD crew to get a fix and it was sorted within two weeks. Being one of a tonne of customers\/players I personally think that is a fast service. The game is fun playing as both a survivor and a killer with many strategies out there to try but I think if there were a walkie talkie available for the survivors to communicate to each other with then that could make it more fun. Of course the walkie talkie would make noise so then it would be fair for the killer I guess?To me the game is definitely worth the purchase if you're into the whole survivor horror thing or if you like slaughtering people and hanging them on hooks....

{"date_posted":"2016-07-03","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":62,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"I've never really tried posting official like reviews before so forgive me if I get some sort of formatting wrong. Dead by Daylight to me is a great game and I've enjoyed it immensley however after taking a bit of time to skim through some reviews both positive and negatives I get where the problems lie. So here's my attempt to go through the good the bad and the homicidal. The GoodThere are plenty of good things about this game at least from the bit I've played. The aesthetics music enviroments and everything else really do help to build up the setting of a good 'ol slasher flick and even things as simple as the faint heartbeat I hear that signals a somewhat nearby killer can set my hairs on end. Leveling up is nice and rewarding and it always makes me smile to get a new perk or the next rank in a perk I find useful. Some of the items are a bit versatile (Like the Toolbox or Map) especially with add ons (I'll go more into those in a bit) leading to there being a few different ways to go about things. The BadOf course not everything is perfect and I find that I have to agree with most negative reviews that claim that there's more flaws than there are good things. The difference between a low level character and a high level character is vast. During my playthroughs after a while I noticed something. I was winning far more matches than I was losing (I tend to play survivors) and all of a sudden I seemed to be great at the game. While that feels good to me personally I eventually figured out that it was because my perks were a bit OP. Again great for me bad for the poor sod playing the killer. More balancing will definitely be required. Second and I'll be blunt I think this ranking system is a crock of s**t. Mostly de ranking if you don't \"do enough to help your team\/murder people\". I sort of like the idea of the ranking system but losing a rank just because I was unlucky and spawned close to the killer was caught immediately and was bodycamped (I'll also go into this later) is unnacceptable. And this has happened to me many many times. And while I never experienced it I watched a Youtube Let's Player go through the hassle of a survivor abusing the vaults and pallets. I have no real ideas on how this could be solved but abusing the enviroment happens all too often (I try not to do this when I can but I'm guilty of it too sometimes.) Also the all time game ruiner for me bodycamping. My god. Do I hate bodycamping. It basically ensures that nobody but the most ballsy of people will help you and then you'll die and probablly lose a precious pip. Ugh... Now the main problem most people seem to have is that there's no party sysem (Besides kill your friends) and honestly I play solo so I haven't had too much of a problem with it. I get why the devs didn't put one it and it doesn't really bother me as much as it seems to bother others. There are plenty of bugs and glitches in the game (some that I've been on the recieving end of. Ouch.) and it can ruin the fun plenty. And while it's a tiny problem and I know it's going to change the customization is sorely lacking. I don't like walking into a lobby to see that everyone is not only the person I'm playing but also look exactly like me (which has happened). Again small thing but I'd like it fixed. Summary Wow. All of that bad with only a little good. So why is this still reccommended? Well no matter how you cut it this game is still at least a little entertaining. The concept is good the style and sounds are excellent the enviroment is great and while there are many problems the devs have said that they will try to put in a patch to work towards fixing these at least once a week. So there's still hope that the game will get even better and for the most part I trust these devs. (They haven't betrayed it yet.) Could this game have used more time on the planning and developing boards? Sure but I still think it's a great game nonetheless and I reccommend it.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2016-07-27","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":64,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"Very fun game however it is essentially an early access game hidden as a complete release. I'll start with the positive side. POSITIVES There is a ranking system which adds a sense of competitiveness to the game. It also makes you feel like what you do and how you play matters. Also you now as of a recent patch can survive with friends. Make your own lobby and then queue for a public match you can also make private matches. Surviving with friends has made the enjoyable experience that I have found within the game. However this is not to imply that solo queue isn't fun it still offers close to the same amount of fun. There are 4 different characters to choose from and with all of them you are able to customize what they wear or slightly change what they look like. Each have 3 preset features head torso and lower body. In relation to these 4 characters is a long list of perks you can achieve with them. Some perks you get random some are specific to the character. For me it has made me genuinely like the character I play and only play for that matter (Dwight). With this long list of perks comes a plethora of different kinds of collectibles you can use in game such as tools offerings and add on's. All these things give you a slight or big advantage in the game. The game is being actively worked on and patches come out on a consistent basis. NEGATIVES As stated at the very beginning this game is essentially an early access disguised as a full and complete release. There are some cons that could and do ruin the game for people. The first one that comes to mind is the queueing system. If you queue with your friends which more than likely you'll be doing more than often every time the game fails to find you a lobby you have to manually select ready and queue again. It is indeed very annoying and frustrating since it already takes a decent while to find a game and you don't want to have to think about floating over the game to check if you need to ready up again. There are also a lot of bugs with queueing and connection as you will enter a game and find yourself on the escaped screen (end game screen) or you will disconnect. Personally I do not recall if I have ever disconnected but it happens to my friends fairly often. Speaking of connection every lobby you join the killer is the host so you WILL lag in some games you play. It'd be fair if it happened to everyone but it doesn't. It helps the killer catch you and everyone else much easier than what it should. In other words the killer has a huge advantage in this way. Another thing that is a very frustating thing about the game is that killers camp. Yes after you get wounded they place you on a hook until your health runs out and you are sacrificed. Usually with some decent players they can unhook you and you can escape. However killers will camp these hooks and there is no way to combat this in terms of having a perk or a certain mechanic in the game. This behavior as I think I should call it makes the game less enjoyable for everyone and instantly ruins your run you know your run is done if the killer camps you. This is all the negatives I can think about as of now. CONCLUSION Although the negatives look like they far outweigh the positives I still recommend this game. In the end I still have fun and have a for the most part enjoyable experience. What I think is that if you are the kind of person that likes to play a more than complete game and can't deal with essentially game breaking bugs and\/or glitches this game is not for you. You will have to truck through the inbalance and bugs that are within this game. All in all I think this is a quality game and the pricing for it is very fair in my opinion. I recommend this game in general and ESPECIALLY to people that plan to play this with friends. A high 7\/10 and it will only get better as patches come out.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It captures the feeling of being in a horror movie and helps the player feel more immersed with the use of not only sight but also sound. My review will cover both the survivor aspect of the game and the killer. SURVIVOR The game puts players who chose to be the survivors in a great feeling of becoming hunted by a killer. They have the advantage of having 4 people to work together and outsmart the killer while completing the tasks at hand. I love playing the survirors but one thing I would like to see is diffrent objectives that they have to do inorder to open the gate that allows them to exit. Otherwise I like playing the survivors. KILLER I like how the killer is put into the position of a hunter. He is at a both an advantage and disadvatage. His advantage is that his goal is simple. But the killer is also at a great disadvantage because its a 4v1. But still killer is fun to play and each one has a diffrent style of play. I love the killer role also because each player plays diffrently. Some people like to camp while others like to roam. It makes the game more intresting to see how each player acts as a killer. Nitpick Sometime there are glitches like once my characters level progression got deleted back to lvl one from lvl 4. Also sometimes the game lags. None of this is so bad that it makes the game worse or harms it in anyway.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

But within the hour ive played so far I enjoyed myself and can see further enjoyment with the game. Played a couple rounds as the survivor and as the killer. Each time you play the game changes bringing all new obstacles to the game. Ive played each killer so far and two different survivors. My favorite killer so far has to be the wraith killer the 3rd one added in. Graphics are ok but at the moment im only using a gtx 550ti as my 980ti had to be RMA'ed. Game runs smooth I havent experienced any lag issues yet. Games load realtively quick. All n all so far it seems to be a solid survival game.

It's really cool but nowhere near perfect. Here is the judgement.Pros + original idea that inspired F13 The game and Last Year + sets up the horror atmosphere nicely feels really intimidating + variety of killers and survivors + each of them has unique perks and abilities + developers are adding new content + rewards for leveling up + bloodweb system + pretty well balanced + you can play as Michael Myers 3Cons HORRIFIC textures altrough this game runs on Unreal Engine 4 its graphics are average numerous bugs and glitches often unable to connect and somtimes it disconnects you from the game sometimes laggyAlso this game has paid DLCs but in my opinion id doesn't fit into any category. Each DLC cost 7 each gives you one killer + one survivor new perks and skins. I also cannot decide where to put price of the game 20 is kinda lot but in my opinion you get pretty much everything this game promises.Judgement This game is cool but it still has a long way to go in order to be great. Until at least the bugs and textures are fixed i cannot give it higher rating. But this game IS addicting and it'll keep you busy for some time.7.5\/10","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

You can literally dash through the map and insta kill survivors because the teleport is insanely hard to dodge if you are against an experienced nurse. You can't escape from the nurse but you can't even \"duel\" with her. You can try to avoid her teleport by going close but this is the thing She can see you and hit you while on the way of teleporting and you can't all you see is a little white trail. Plus the wall passing ability is bs. It's just too op. If they nerf my opinion will change but for now the game is a bad game because of the 100xjoin lobby button presses and the nurse.ay don't take me seriously I probably had 200 hrs in the game and I was salty as boi nurse isn't op ok go awaythough teh game is good the updates are bad. Wait did I just read \"out of beta stage\"?(insert heavy laugh)Nope. This is not even beta stage early access tbh. And man does this game gonna ever get a larger discount? I hope so. I'd buy the game but those 18 99 s are a lot for a simple game like this. Maximum price should be 15 and maybe get atleast a 50% DISCOUNT!!!So um prices aren't a problem but it is for me. Because maybe HUF is like idk stone against diamond? bear against fly?But overall the game is good except for some bad updates they or he\/she need to think the updates through more and more.

This game is fun to play for a couple of hours but after that it can get frustrating becuase many players both killer and surivivors may play in a way that you may not like. Playing with people with your same level if fun but when it goes above that or under it becomes anoying or even boring to play. A good group of survivors can win most games because of the comunication factor and killers may camp the kill if they feel like it but if you decide to comit to this game and spend time playing it you will always have a soft spot in your heart for the game. Might be buggy sometimes unfair or who knows but aslong as you don't take anything to heart and just be you then you will find yourself spending alot of time playings this game.

Simple. His tools are his powers his weapons and hooks a local god\/devil\/demon entity provides. So far so simple.In a game. About a Killer. Trying to kill people. Should what never happen?That the friggin people you try to kill actually bodyblock you into oblivion. Literally. Survivors can run circles around the killer bodyblock him from getting people or hanging them and all of that they do completely unpunished. No literally unpunished. As of right now the survivors have far too many tools at hand to fend off the killer. Which would be fine if the killer wouldn't need 2 hits to down someone and then take a stroll through an insane asylum to find the nearest hook... which by the way the survivors can destroy except 4 who are in really hard to get to places. Playing it as a group of 5 in a private match super fun. Playing it alone and trying to kill people ing frustrating to the point of quitting.

{"date_posted":"2016-08-02","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":22,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"This game has a great amount of potential... But that potential is not there just yet. I have a laptop with 8 quad core i7s and even on the lowest graphic settings I can get 25 fps (tops!) And although that is a personal issue there are many issues in game that can easily ruin every game you play all relating to the survivor. First off if you get downed as the last survivor and the killer decides to dance around you there is no benefit to healing up your character nor moving anywhere. You will be trolled until you bleed out. Secondly and this is a big one when the killer puts you on a hook the killer will puppy guard your dangling body waiting for either you to die without anyone nearby or for someone to try to rescue you which will get you and that said player killed... not fun at all. And while on the topic of being on a hook attempting to pull yourself off said hook is a joke! Out of the multiple games I've played in Dead by Daylight I have only seen ONE guy free himself. and he had a perk to help him. Enough of hooks *shudder*. The last thing I feel needs to be improved is the teamwork or lack thereof. Teamwork implies a group of people (the survivors) working together to achieve a common goal (escaping). Playing with random people usually means they will not help you. They will 3\/4ths of the time stay away from hanged people and if the killer is after them try to put the weaker players in the killers crosshairs. If you are unsure if you want this game or not my answer is do not get this game NOW but always keep an eye on it. With the right patching this game can be the next great horror game. But as I mentioned at the beginning this game has a lot of potential. To give a good comparison this game is like Tom Clancy's The Division's the Dark Zone after the gear score update and could be much better with the right tweaking. Don't make this review a final decision for if you want this or not. I still am happy with my purchase but not with SOME features.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Issues that for some can make this game unplayable. The servers are P2P. Which for those who don't know instead of connecting to the GAME you are esentially connecting to other players which is highly unstable and often results in massive lag. In. Every. Game. You. Play. And if you are ever the killer and any lag happens... expect a lot of hate and death threats in your comments. Check my page for proof.... I play this game with friends and when trying to join a game instead of the lobby constantly searching for a game until it finds one it says \"Failed to join game.\" and Every time that happens each friend I play with has to press ready again. This wouldn't be a big deal if it was about 3 times we had to ready up. However you have to do this about 20 50 times before finding a game and sometimes if a game is found one of your friends is kicked out randomly. These are the biggest issues. It definitely feels like it should still be in alpha. There are so many problems that it hurts me because the concept is the most amazing multiplayer concept I have seen in years. HOWEVER!!! You probably have seen many reviews not recommending this game because of all of these issues. I will tell you. Me and my friends persevere because it is so incredibly fun when it actually works. If you can have the patience to deal with these problems than get it... because it'll be worth it.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Then while i was in game i noticed something... The Killer was a huntress but she was not an ordinary huntress. She was the most beautiful huntress i had ever seen. I decided i would treat her as any other killer and try to advoid her as much as i can.Moving on to the end of the game. i was almost done with the generator 2 people have died and the huntress no where to be seen aswell as the other surviver. I missed my last skill check and all the sudden the huntress was near. I ran away from my generator trying to be as sneaky as i could be but to her luck she saw me. she ran towards me while i ran away from her (even tho i just wanted to hug her). I may say i didnt care if i lost now. I felt a weird connection to her. I stopped running standing on one side of a pallet while she stopped on the other side. We starred at eachother for a while. the other surviver had fleed and we were alone in the map. i stood up and walked to her while she still was standing still. we now stood face to boob and not one tried to either run or attack. Then she turned around and ran toward the exit. she stood infront of the way out where she nooded. Was i suppose to walk out? we both knew that we couldnt walk out the gate together.. Her last wish was for me to live my life so she let me go. she could have killed me if he wanted to but she didnt. Her last words in chat was \"GG my friend )\" I didnt have time to respond but i know she knew i loved her..so to conclude i hate how hard it is to befriend a killer and after let them go.I miss you my huntress &lt 3","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I actually really enjoyed playing this game. Lots of reviewers complain that you can't find a match but I had absolutely no trouble finding a match 90% of the time.It does have a few flaws though. The monsters do seem overpowered since I played about 10 games and never won as the humans. Also it seems almost impossible to escape a monster once they've spotted you even if you use the traps and windows. But despite all this I had fun.6 7\/10.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

If you dont know about the things in Dead By Daylight first of all there are 2 completely free DLCs 3 cosmetic DLCs and 3 other DLCs with new killers and survivors and perks oh and at least one new map (which you don't need the dlc to play on). The money DLC killers include Michael Myers The Hag and I believe his name is The Doctor. For the money DLC survivors there is Feng Min Laurie Strode And Ace (I don't know his last name). For killers from the average game no DLCs included there is The Trapper The Hillbilly And the Wraith. For the no DLC survivors there is Meg Thomas Dwight Fairfield Clauddete Morele And Jake Park. For the free DLC killer there is The Nurse and for survivors you have William\"Bill\"Overbeck And Nea Karlsson.

Great concept I love the gameplay! However the p2p connection concept here is horrible! Horrible load times going into games and sometimes would get kicked out of the room. I know it's not internet speed either I have 100 Mbps speed. They need dedicated servers! Not everyone has a system capable of handling such a load.It just sucks when you load up to play and you spend 30% of your time waiting for the room to load versus actually playing and I'm not really exaggerating. Load times were well over 10 mins in some cases. I timed them that's how bad they were.

The only reason it's released is because we as consumers have ridiculously low standards.If you're okay with the way the game is set up and you're in it with a more...competitive manner in mind then you'll be disappointed (unless you're lucky) seeing as they're constantly trying to shove unfair advantages down our throats by encouraging us to use addons\/offerings every single game and which ones you get ofcourse is completely random meaning that the outcome of a game more or less depends on how lucky you were when you opened up your blood tree.The fact that you're not even able to group up with your friends to play online is ridiculous. People who have played it might try to bring up the argument of \"HURR DEY R TRYIN 2 MEK IT FEIR SO SURVIVURS CENT COMMUNICET DURR\" okay so what you're saying is that they're focusing on fairness between the Survivors and the Killer? Which is then contradicted by the fact that this game relies HEAVILY on how lucky you are with the perks you're able to purchase in the blood tree.Imagine a team of survivor and just 1 of them having the sprint perk and the Killer's been unlucky with his blood tree and he has something like Deerstalker.. Yea no that one guy he's gone don't matter if you on his he gone.Oor a team of survivors with a perk like \"HURR WE CEN SEE DUH BEAR TREPS WITHIN 2 METUR REDIUS\" while their killer is someone like the Wraith with the crow perk yea no they're all ed. Every single Survivor? Yea dead. Just dead.I mean... one positive is if you actually have an abundance of friends with this game and at least 3 of them are ready to play 24\/7... then yes by all means it's only like 20 bucks or something and you'll probably have a good time.If you DON'T have 50 friends with this game then skip skip skip save your money for drugs and alcohol and your next door stripper","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Matchmaking is not balanced so dont expect a fair fight but that being said even with nothing you can win.Overall an okay and playable game would not recommend as some issues need resolving.got on discount for $16USD Currently in a $10USD state. Fun in private bad in casual.Would recommend DEV's add the same progreeeion levels\/upgrades for private matches BUT have them seperate. As trying to play Casual to level up tends to be problematic.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

NO group queue available for ranked play so if you wanted to play ranked with friends like it's meant to be.. you're outta luck you CAN'T.(biggest problem with this game)2. in the settings menu you have VERY little options available.3. you CANNOT change any of the key binds you don't like crouching with left control key? too bad get used it because you can't change it... you can't change ANY of the binds.4. there is no way of communicating with other survivors once in the game no hand cues no voice chat and NOT EVEN a team chat where you could simply type and let the other survivors know if they should come for a rescue or if the killer set a trap in front of the hook etc... no communication AT ALL inside the game. technology not there yet i guess?","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

But once I started I found out very quick that it is an extremely difficult game to play.What I mean by difficult is that the game teaches you by reading tons and tons of text explaining the game. I personally found that once I played actual matches that there was a disconnect from learning the game and playing it. This game desperately needs an AI mode where you can train as a suvivor or as a killer. But all in all there is too little in the early game to keep me interested in leveling up to get better gear. I get matched with players that have way more stuff than I do both as killer and survivor. Makes it nearly impossible for me to feel like I'm progressing in the game. The game mode itself is extremely short. At least it seems to be in the early game. My advice #1 Get an AI offline mode#2 Help us noobs learn in other ways besides reading walls of text","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

It's a great title that's basically the only good game in the genre. It's slightly buggy (nothing gamebreaking in my experience) they need to implement some more configurable game options and leveling up perks is a bit too grindy in my opinion. That being said I really enjoy the game playing as Survivor has super intense high skillcap competitive gameplay the game has a great soundtrack and solid graphics with a nice art style. These all culminate into an utterly chilling atmosphere and combining that with The Survivors intense gameplay can lead to some horrifying highlights. Furthermore it's highly rewarding coordinating plays with a group of friends. As for Killer it's also extremely fun but it s completely different. Playing Killer is much more laid back and is great for having a good time and relaxing. Overall the game is easily worth its price tag.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The game ITSELF is worse than an early access game. You vault away from the killer to be downed once you cross the other side. You rubber band from place to place because the servers suck.You get saved and fly away off the map to be placed onto a different hook??? because the killer sees you on the ground.You open chests to fall off the map and say youve been sacraficed. YOU DON'T BOTHER SAVING YOUR TEAMMATES BECAUSE THE RISK REWARD IS SO LOW BECAUSE THE KILLER WAITS TILL YOURE DEAD. AND YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH THEM IN ANY WAY SAYING THE KILLER IS STILL THERE plus if they manage to get you off you cant outrun him and vaulting is too broke to lose him. best thing to do before a match is say \"spam m1 if hes camping you\"YOU CANT EVEN HIDE BECAUSE YOUR VIEW MODEL STICKS OUT OF CLOSETS. but its not like anyones going to save you anyway.THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE SO FUN WHEN THEY FIX ALL THE But you'll be playing something else because this will be old news.

But other than that the game is extremely fun when you're not getting kicked from lobbies or searching for one. I played as the killer for all of the BETA and it was extremely fun especially when you had clueless victims. Now on release I play as the survivor and if you're the paranoid type this game will definitely keep you on your toes. And when teamwork comes around and you find people who are actually willing to work with you the game is even better. In all honesty though if I were you I'd keep the $20 and wait to see how the game goes after time by that I mean how much content the devs decide to release if it's free and most importantly if people keep playing for what you would consider $20 worth if so then pull out that piggy bank mate.

The killer hunts for survivors and hooks to sacrifice them. 4 survivors repair 5 generators in order to open the exit. Though at first you find yourself hard to survive\/kill but as your skill accumulates you know how to free yourself from the killer or how to catch survivors from the back. A highlight of this game is different killers and survivors have their own unique perks sabotaging hooks with bare hands for instance. Combining different items like toolbox or med kit with certain perks will make you an escape artist. Also you can provide offerings to the entity and it will reward you like prevents 3 hooks from appearing or grants you the ability to execute any one of the survivor. No worries about people will remember the spots because they are randomly assigned on the maps! The rule is simple escape or kill but various elements make this game glow.Death is not an escape )","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Why?The biggest issue is probably the fact that there are no dedicated servers or I assume there aren't because almost every single game is laggy. We have a 100mb connection and the problems are ridiculous. Survivors lagging out before the game starts me or my mrs lagging out whilst connecting to the lobby the killer lagging out within the first 10 seconds of a game. Even if no one lags out the connection is almost always terrible. In 8 hours of playing the game I think we've had 2\/3 \"perfect games\" without lag or people disconnecting.I can look beyond the \"cheap\" tactics that the community uses I don't care if we win or lose the atmosphere of the game is superb and being chased by the killer is intense. There's no other game that I can sit playing with my mrs in silence and then my pants because she suddenly screams because the killer is chasing her. This is honestly one of the best multiplayer games I have played in the genre if not the best it reminds me of the old Splinter Cell Double Agent multiplayer years ago (which also suffered exactly the same issues). Such a shame that the lag and technical issues spoil it.Tl dr Put your f*cking hands in your pockets devs and make dedicated servers it's not like you haven't made millions from your other games you're not an indie developer so there's no excuse.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Think of all the triple A games released this year now think of how long it took those games to get fixed guess what those games had millions of dollars worth of funding behind them and multiple dev teams for each seperate glitch. Dead By Daylight is a tiny dev team and they release patches VERY frequently and they listen to feedback all the time so is it full of bugs and some bad game design sure but its being worked on and I'd like to see you come up with an idea like this AND make it a reality.If you got through all of this and 100 % agree add me on steam and we'll destroy enemy killers.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},
{"date_posted":"2016-12-17","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":264,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Not Recommended","review":"Key note I would not recommend this game FOR NOW. I still play it however because the concept is good and I enjoy matches now and then.The main problem right now is that the game itself is riddled with bugs that the devs have not yet fixed. I got this game when it was newly released and while it was glitchy before it has since become worse.Playing a killer is relatively easy as you host the game. You can barely play a survivor now because you fail to join lobbies 90% of the time or get stuck on loading screens before or after the game starts.Hence I cannot understand for the life of me why there would be a free to play weekend for DBD when there are glaring issues with the game.Fixing this problem would change my review to 'would recommend'.Aside from that I feel like you have to rely on luck sometimes when playing this game. I feel like some perks or skills are imbalanced and make the game unenjoyable at times. I'm not sure if the issues I'm going to write about are actual problems that should be balanced as they might be countered by strategy or simply luck.&lt b&gt &lt u&gt Killer&lt \/b&gt &lt \/u&gt I've played only one round as a survivor against the hag.Was the last survivor and fixed the last two generators as I couldn't find the trapdoor. Killer placed traps around exits rendering me unable to activate the exits as she can simply teleport to where I am.&lt b&gt &lt u&gt Survivor&lt \/b&gt &lt \/u&gt Entered round as a killer with 3 Megs Sprint burst coupled with inifite juking and palleting.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

A free weekend review Dead by Daylight stopped working several times in the lobby in the loading screen of a match. Once I teleported over the map until the killer got me. And if the killer gets you he has you on the hook. He waits. You're done game over. Teamwork is crucial or so to speak a \"play with friends to succeed\" game. I enjoyed to play the killer much more than the victim. Unfortunately this game has only one mode and the mode itself doesn't provide a big scope of action.

{"date_posted":"2016-12-18","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":6,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Not Recommended","review":"Product received for free. To start off i only played this game during the 24 hour free period but these are my personal beliefs. The game is great when you can actually get into a lobby the problem comes from trying to get into a lobby. About every 2 times you try to join a lobby you will either get an error message of it will try to connect you to a lobby and 15 minutes later it will still be trying to connect you with no way of backing out leading you to exit and restart the game. Once you find a lobby it's pretty straightforward you ready up and a minute later you're connecting to the game. However if the killer backs out of said lobby before the game is finished loading you will be stuck waiting another 15 minutes before coming to the realization that it's not going to let you join. The lobbies are also generated off of killers being host which causes problems with lag sometimes i had this happen in about 4 of the matches i played as survivor. Now lets say you got into a lobby and a game with a killer and 4 survivors the game is tons of fun especialy when you get that feeling of juking a killer or saving a teamate from being sacrificed. To me the game is not worth the $20 dollar price tag when every other game you can't even connect to and have to restart the game. If these glitches were fixed it honestly would be a great game but after playing it for free im gonna take my money somewhere else.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2016-12-28","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":66,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"This game has drawn me in pretty hard I have mainly good things to say but some negative as well. To start this game combines a cohesive multiplayer experience with a nerve wracking thriller. The game of cat and mouse between survivors and killers is a gripping experience that sets it apart from its competitors. This game employs a risk and reward system that drives it to be fast paced and dangerous. Repairing sabotaging and even healing can draw the killer down on you if you fail to perform the necessary skill checks. There is a fun leveling system in place that gives the player an assortment of items add on's and powerful perks that change the way the game plays. On the other spectrum their is a diverse cast of killers that all play differently giving the player options to tailor his choices to his preferred play style. There must always be some bad with the good ill lead this by saying that everything i list below is fixable non game breaking and has not ruined the game for me. The first thing is something I am sure the Devs know all about. The cheaters are a pox on this game whether it be cheats or exploits it seems like in 10 games you will run into at least 1 2 cheaters on both killer and survivor side. I'd love to see a dev crack down. The second thing nearly ruins the fun of playing a killer. The sabotage system needs to seriously be nerfed or a system needs to be implemented to balance it for the killers. In the first few minutes of the game every hook but the basement can be sabotaged easily by two survivors. Everyone has this perk now because it was on the shrine of secrets during a double blood point xmas weekend. Last night I played 6 games as the killer and to my annoyance i only had one game without a full scale sabotage on all my hooks. Im not a rank 1 killer these arent pros they are just normal players. Once your hooks are gone you can count on all players avoiding your basement like the plague and unless you have the final rank of Iron Grasp good luck carrying them all the way to the basement. If you do make that attempt you can count on them to run to the corner and let you hit them knowing that you cant take them back. You have a knife in your hand but are unable to use it to end them without the use of a single use rare item that must be pre placed. So you think. Okay I will just leave him here and go find someone else he will eventually bleed out. Wrong the other survivors automatically know where that downed player is at all times. You can camp him but they will just stay away and bring up generators. With the loss of all hooks the killer is left defenseless and with little hope of 'winning.' You can only just chase and attack as much as you can to try to Eke out extra points before they eventually escape. The killers need an option to combat this. The third and final Negative thing I have found about the game is a problem with disconnecting killers. This is real minor but if a killer disconnects early on in a match player ranks are not protected without getting enough points to maintain your progress to the next rank you will lose one tick. That is not really fair its not the survivors fault that the killer left. A great game for sure with a few fixable things I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys multiplayer edge of your seat experiences.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2017-09-04","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":394,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Not Recommended","review":"By far the worst match making i've ever experianced in a \"competitive\" game. If you're a new player prepare to be on constantly by vets with all the best perks unlocked while you're able to flop around like a fish with your one minor. I can understand match making issues with players ranking down but atleast let me play with players of a similar level that only have one or two slots unlocked.Other than that the gameplay is very frustrating too. I'm supposed to be a scary killer but the other survivors crouch in front of you to block your movement and can pretty easily 360 spin away if you actually try to hit them. The game feels heavily favored for the survivors especially if they are coordinated with voice chat. If a survivor is getting someone off the hook and is hit they should be interupted. If you want to play killer against a coordinated team it feels like you're a clown there for their entertainement and they'll BM all the way up to making sure you watch them escape.Honestly don't see what the fuss is about i'm sure it gets more fun after you get the OP perks but i'm not going to invest 60 hours for the chance at fun.EDIT* Now have the meta perks for most killers at 250 hours and the game hasn't gotten more fun. The devs are low rank survivor players and the game is HEAVILY survivor favored. They have so many crutches it's amazing. Really don't play this game as killer unless you like being on as the survivors can pretty much make you their for entire matches.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I'll just list a few problems with this game for you. When all the new items came out (in this patch) deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com most of them didn't work and some of them still don't. Infinites still exist Trapping under hooks was just fixed after being an issue for 6+ months (it was obviously an unfun mechanic that was hated by the community because it made it impossible to save teammates) If you bring an item into the game from your inventory and drop it you can't pick it back up There are lockers on maps that a killer can't open if a survivor is in it. You can get out of the Asylum map with a regenerating hook bug because they developers didn't remove the hitboxes clips.twitch.tv Lag is still a big issue because you can't see your flipping ping for some reason clips.twitch.tv Another funny lag clip clips.twitch.tv The lost save file bug that happened Flashlights are still bugged clips.twitch.tv They release paid DLC with a perk that doesn't even work (decisive strike exploit) Bugged pallets on some maps that the killer can't get passed. Released the new DLC with major bugs (Spark of Madness). The Doctor can swing while carrying a survivor and it doesn't have any effect on his movement speed. Also I've levelled up the new survivor 10 times and I have no perks\/items\/offerings. The new maps are terrible all maps are exactly the same (jungle gyms). Facecamping is still a thing This pallet bug that happens all the time. clips.twitch.tv Is it worth buying?No not really considering they keep releasing paid DLC when half the bugs and other bad things in the game haven't been fixed. I used to give the developers credit but I quit for a few months and they didn't change anything. I've had to deal with losing all of my progress a few times already but I just downloaded a save file off of the internet. Now with this recent patch I've started losing all my items for my killers.Edit Friday the 13th The Game came out a few days ago. Most people gave it a negative review because it had server issues (Dead by Daylight never had this because it doesn't have dedicated servers). I would put your money towards this game instead it has a better chance of actually being fixed loved and updated.

If you don't get into the game the system will kick you out and make you queue up again. Queue should not have to be entered multiple times the player should remain in the queue until he or she finds a game. Easy ways to exploit the blood system in multiplayer No blood given for playing with friends as the killer. (And while I realize that allowing this would allow some serious exploits they could have given a seperate bloodpool for offline play so you and your friends can still play together and level up in a different manner.)Overall I think this is a great game but certainly not for everyone. I'd recommend watching some videos before you get it just to make sure it boasts the type of gameplay you're looking for.

You crash wayyyyyy too often. You set a trap you crash you hook someone you crash you pick up someone you crash. It's just crash report after crash report with nothing getting fixed. The only time it doesnt crash is when youre playing survivor and you just cant win survivor at least not as easily as a killer. You'll constantly be matched with rank 1 killers and just get creamed. The game runs like even on good cards and the devs dont seem to give a . The learning curve is steep. I guarentee you'll ing hate this game when you start.

The game itself is good but FILLED with bugs and I am gonna name a few 1.Getting kicked out of a match2.If you unhook someone in their last seconds the game will bug the player will be 'undead' but won't be able to move at all and not able to take damage or anything also the hook won't break3.You can get trapped on under or inside pallets4.LagOther complains 1. It takes too long for games to take place. Why don't you reward players that press 'Quick Match??'2. I play mainly killer and i hate camping\/campers. You fixed infinities so why don't you make camping not a viable strategy? It is anti fun and killers still get points because altruistic players do dumb mistakes. If survivers don't have infinities why do killers have camping?3. Why are killers unique but survivers are not? After you unlocked the perks you want you can just play Claudette.4. Nurse went from best to disgustingly bad.Hopefully you will do something","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

Over'all i would have given this game the 8\/10 it could have deserved but with the constant changes to the game keep in mind most updates that come out for the game are Changes. not many fixes to maps\/balancing to perks and fixing glitches. my final review for this game would be a 6\/10. For Updates 1.4.1 to 1.4.2 these two major updates solved alot of dead by daylights balancing problems.Iron Grasp is weaker Killers can now damage gens leaving no gen to 99% all the time.etc.for my final thought \"infinites\" now when on the surviving team most map layouts have what players call an \"infinite\" which is exploiting the layout of the map for your personal gain killer will end up catching the survivor but just ended up wasting time.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I was not too impressed to start. After playing over that weekend with some friends i started having a lot of fun as a survivor. Enough fun that i bought the game. I am around 80 hours now and i still want to go back for more. It's most fun with friends. As far as balance I personally feel like Killers are over powered. When i play as killer (i don't much) i always get 3 out of 4 survivors on average and 9 out of 10 games i double (rank) pip. I also always gain about 30 50% more bloodpoints then any survivor. Between all the perks that give me half a$$ wall hacks as a killer and the bloodlust and lunge with 3 hooks at every corner i basicly never lose or do bad as a killer. Do the devs on this game want the killer to be this way? It feels like something is wrong here. That said a good survivor will still do good but ultimatly in the end it hardly matters. As for survivors? I see players who main as Killers every game say that survivors are OP. As a killer i never seen an OP survivor. As a survivor i am always feeling overpowered by the killer. That's just how i feel.To the Point It's a good game. Fun to play with friends.Community is full of Salt. Killers hate survivor players and Survivors hate Killer players.Mechanics are decent and simple to learn. Games typically last from 12 30 minutes.Graphics are good but not the best a bit glitchy at times. A few minor bugs.Killer is strong and survivors are weak. In the begining you will get sh*t on.(UPDATE)coming up on 300 hours and i am still having a lot of fun with this game. Aside from some things that seem a little broken I think they did a pretty good....job so far.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The game idea is an amazing concept but the devs are so far up the killers behinds that no matter how strong they become they dont get nerfed. Each patch that is released the killer in some way is buffed making the game unfair to the point of you might as well just not play. You'll come across the second most toxic community the first being league of legends with the killers often post game saying you are noob for using the game mechanics that availble if anything is not to the killers like the devs are quick to change it so that is not in the game anymore. According to the killers the suvivors are over powered so they had many of the only defense taken out which was the pallets but no according to killers the survivors are always the over powered ones even though they move slower and cannot fight back dont worry the devs will quickly nerf the survivors more so that the killers can stop cryin. I would not recommend this game to anyone as it is not worth the 15 pound price tag also did I mention that all the killers that you pay for are incredibly over powered which makes this game a pay to win.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

That's not a bad thing but I feel like it lacks staying power as a result. I would give this game with all the time I've spent on it a loving 7.5\/10.

{"date_posted":"2017-09-12","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":207,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Recommended","review":"Dead By Daylight feels like two great games in one. You can play alone as one of many killers in first person view or as a survivor on a team of four in third person view. Each survivor plays very similar to the others while each killer is different enough from the rest to warrant lots of gameplay. Playing as a survivor is very intense and made even more fun when playing with friends. You may also choose a mode that allows a party of two to five friends play together where one is the killer and the rest are survivors. This mode is unranked and you gain no levels but everything is unlocked for you so you get to experiment with different builds and strategies for both the killers and survivors. For the price it is an amazing value.It isn't completely without its faults. With any online game you'll run into the occasional bad apple of the online community. Don't let this sour you on this game. Instead let a random disconnect put a damper on your experience. In the 14.5 hours I've played in the past week since picking this up I have not personally been disconnected but many of my friends that I play with have which really stinks for the survivors. The game can also be a little unintuitive making some knowledge almost impossible to learn without using an external resource such as Reddit. The UX leaves a bit to be desired but overall I would still highly recommend this game as it is fun enough to see past these minor gripes.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

{"date_posted":"2016-07-11","funny":0,"helpful":0,"hour_played":348,"is_early_access_review":false,"recommendation":"Not Recommended","review":"Dead by Daylight is a very fun game that I still can't recommend as it's still not finished. As of the date of this review you should consider this game early access.Gameplay The core gameplay is very fun when bugs toxic players or bad peer to peer connections don't hinder the experience. I find playing both sides to be challenging and rewarding. I personally like the killer because of the frantic nature. However I still enjoy the careful and thoughtful play required to win as the survivor. Both roles can be surprisingly tense and I love it. The ranking system is stupid. You are penalized for being efficient as both killer and survivor. As the killer if you find everyone and do a good job of chasing them down never letting them escape you get far less points. It may even be possible to kill the entire team and get deranked (I know it was before the patch that increased some point values). As a survivor you're heavily penalized for doing well. For example I soloed three generators opened the exit gate and healed another survivor without getting spotted once. I even waited for the killer at the exit which is a cheesy way to get some bonus points for being chased and escaping. I got 9 300 points which is 700 shy of ranking up. When you come up short of 10k not only do you not gain rank you actually derank meaning missing out on a few points will cost you two ranks. You'll often see survivors repairing generators after a match where the killer was dominated because they know if they escape they won't reach the 10k thresthold and will be deranked. Controls Functional but with issues. The fact that there is no keybinding certainly doesn't help matters. No crouch toggle either. My main issue with the controls is how fiddly it can be sometimes when there are multiple things to interact with and those actions share the same input. As a survivor it can be difficult to disarm a bear trap under a hooked survivor because depending on placement you sometimes have to back up a little to find the sweet spot where the unhooking prompt goes away and is replaced by the disarm trap prompt. As a killer it can be tricky to pick up a downed survivor next to a windows as &lt space&gt both picks up survivors and steps through windows. It can also be difficult to find the sweet spot when attempting to pick a survivor up who is caught in a bear trap. I'm sure there are more examples but the point is there are too many actions assigned to the same inputs which creates problems.Graphics Pretty meh. Muddy textures a very aggressive depth of field effect (probably a style choice but I find it obnoxious) level geometry pop in is pretty obvious as well. I wouldn't say it detracts from the experience too much except for perhaps the pop in.Sound Excellent. Stellar. Masterful. Praise worthy. The music the sound effects. The ambient sounds. Top notch! I'm glad they nailed this because sound cues are very important in this game. If you don't play with headphones you're missing out and putting yourself at a disadvantage.Technical A hot mess. No rebindable keys. Very few graphics options beyond presets. I experienced several in game crashes until I tried unplugging my controller (played with KB+M but had my 360 controller pluged in). I've also had the game freeze on the menu 4 times. Terrain clipping issues. Animations will decouple from time to time. Lousy peer to peer connections. Failed to join game failed to join game failed to join game. I'll say that it hasn't often been something game breaking but a lot of little things that make this game feel like a beta or early access.Story No lore explained in game. Go check the website if you actually care. Personally I don't give a toss.Community\/player base Highly cancerous. This has nothing to directly do with the game yet it's important as this game lacks any kind of single player mode. There is a very vocal segment of the community who is upset because the devs removed some crutches such as OP perks and some unintended exploits that allowed people to play survivors recklessly and without having to worry about being spoted by the killer. It feels as though that sentiment has bled into the gameplay as people disconnect (aka DC) as survivors all the time. Not only does the killer lose potential points but it's not fair to the other survivors because even if that person is likely or guaranteed to die staying in the game for as long as possible helps the other survivors. Killers DCing is even worse. There are killers who DC just before the survivors escape and while they don't get deranked they do get cheated out of an earned rank as well as they points they would have got for escaping. The devs tried to fix the issue by penalizing DCers and rewarding killers with points for a DC however as far as I know people are still able to do it without penalty if they DC in a certain way. Regardless DCs happen a lot. My last 4 or 5 matches somebody DCed. DCing can also cause weird issues for the killer in the time between the cheating scrub pulling the plug and game updating the scrubs status to DCed. I once was stuck in front of a hook for about a minute because the scrub I was carrying decided to DC as I was hooking him. I couldn't move or even look around until the game sorted itself out. PROTIP If you don't want to play the game in the way the developers intended and you disagree with the fundamental concept as they've laid out in their Twitch Q&amp A then uninstall the game and play Domination in Call of Duty if you want to rush around capturing objectives. I don't often play as a survivor anymore as I've found I like playing the killer more. When I do play survivor I die... alot. Most of the time it's because I made a bad decision or got outplayed. Sometimes it's bad luck. Deal with it people. Stop your whining and \"git gud.\"Conclusion It's a fun game with meh graphics and amazing sound design. If you're OK with early access then I'd recommend picking it up. If you expect a released game to be finished then wait until things have stabilized and basic features are added with bugs fixed. I will update this review\/rant when I feel the game is suitable to be sold as a finished product.404 out of 10. Would get DCed on again.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I want to tell about the reasons why I DO NOT recommend buying this game!1) Having earned 90 hours one day I go in and my statistics have vanished everything I got in 90 hours ... just disappeared! This is not a single case many forums stuffed with this problem! In a year it has not been concealed!2) A lot of paid additions.3) Small online sometimes even play is not possible for survivors ...4) There are not only bugs with a database (zeroing your statistics) but also in the game process (a bug with the search of players)5) Boring Gemplay ...

It's 4 v 1 and there are no bots or singleplayer. While the game has a few glitches and crashes it still holds true to what I hoped and envisioned for this game to be. Please pay no attention to the negative reviews regarding being able to play with friends online. Those people writing the bad reviews would be the same people writing a bad review if friends were able to join. Communication with teamates during this game would ruin it. If you want to play a survivor horror with your friends go play the million other games out there in which you can. Dead by Daylight has elements in the game that are meant to make the player extremely anxious nervous and panic. My wife son daughter and I all take turns playing this on the big screen as it works well with the steam controller. We all scream when we're being chased!Again don't listen to the bad reviews about being able to play with friends or how the killer just camps the hooks. It's all strategy. If the killer camps the hooks it leaves time for the remaining survivors to get some generators. The game is very well balanced and the graphics are great. I can tell there was alot of work put into this game by Behaviour and this is with no doubt a successfull launch! 9\/10P.S. Thank you Behaviour and Starbreeze! For Father's Day we got to do what I wanted to do all weekend and that was play Dead by Daylight!","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I love this game to death (pun intended) But unless you have perfect internet connection 100% of the time do not spend your money on this game. I've spent more time failing to connect to games then I have actually playing in matches. And when I do get into a match the chances that I will be able to accomplish anything for my team other then being a punching bag for the killer are so small that I've gotten used to it at this point. This is an amazing game with brilliant ideas but the amount of problems that come up from the connection issues for those of us who can't afford perfect internet needs to be fixed before I would feel good about telling my friends to buy this game.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The kind of flaws that get fixed when an indie game ups its status to main stream. There are network issues and the queing system is a big unreliable however the game itself is great. This game is the ultimate lan party. If you have 5 friends on and want to rotate being the killer then you have the makings of a good night in. I strongly recommend it.Looking at all the negative reviews they start with \"I've played 100+ hours of this and...\".

Look at this 1. Boring gameplay. If u killer u need to kill but it s not will be so easy If you Survivor u need to escape. Oh nice game. This every this repeats every game changing only the killer and place. But with lags it becomes even harder2. When i bought no was cards. But now the developers have added. Oh thanks god. But better to purchase these cards separately but not a game.3. New Killers oh nice and? New maps? Thats all? Fix lags? Thanks but no.In 2018 maybe u can buy this game not right now. If you bought this game please accept my condolences and return the money before it's too late","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

The newest feature \"Survive With Friends\" is still glitchy and takes a very long time to match up with a killer if you try to match with 1 or 2 other friends. If you match with 3 other friends as a full team of survivors killers tend to leave the lobby and drop everyone out to the main menu rather than going back to the party lobby. There are a few game glitches such as falling out of the map or getting stuck in the map occasionally. On top of that there are times where your Bloodpoints are counted up but you don't get them after you leave the match.Overall the game is very good for its price and how long its been out. The devs have been very responsive to the community and have been releasing patches to fix the game. I highly recommend this game if you have a friend or two to play with.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},

I watched the developers'videos where they talked about their philosophy and how they wanted to have players be genuinely scared when they played. The game fails to give me any sort of fear whatsoever.The game is also killer sided.

Wow so much fun for everyone....THe people are what suck most about this game. I just want to play winning or losing isn't the point. Being messed with because people want to rank up is SO BORING.All your firends are dead? Hide in a corner till the monster quits.Already have the exit open? Better mess with the monster so you can get all the points.Downed the last survivor? Watch them bleed out until they quit.

Had over 70 hours played before I was able to complete my first match. 1.5 or 2 years later and I can finish about 30% of my matches now at best. Have never succesfully completed a match that I burned party streamers for every single time I get a crash to desktop. That's on a 6 year old core i5 on an asus z68 board with a radeon 380x and the new rig I built is a core i7 6800k 16 gigs dom plats ram evga mobo and evga gtx 1070. Exact same results on both. Took both rigs with me on my vacation to portland oregon and even on comcast roadrunner and fios game has the same damned problems. This game is STILL not in good enough shape to be out of \"early access\" over a year after \"release\". Then it came out on console and it's an inconsistant mess even worse than pc. Yet they are still deleting support threads warning people about this game let alone answering any of the threads asking for help with anything other than the auto generated response. This company does not deserve to have a game on the market. All these problems reported by so many people for so long and they are still cranking out paid fluff dlc as fast as they can rather than fix things. Don't be one of those morons that thinks a game company this small and with this little capital can afford to do both competently. Just look at the way this game's been handled and you'll see the proof of that. And even when it works it has swapped it's polarity so to speak. It started with the killer being the strong one and the survivors had to really out think the killer to escape. Now people play like blind drunk chimps and walk out with 2 pips even if they don't survive. literally a dozen or more \"no brain no skill\" perks have been released for survivor but not killer. A 200% bloodpoint buff perk was put into the game right before a 3x exp event survivor only then decided they were gonna nerf exp perks before giving the killer a taste of the same thing. Pays to be survivor in this game. Then did another 2x exp event before the nerf lol. You wanna play this game and get the survivor feeling we got in the beginning when it actually worked? Play killer. They are the ones that get bullied they play the entire game perfectly and they can still get crap for points and 1 pip they are the ones having to really work at it are constantly stressed and have to deal with a survivor community that is now used to being treated like kings so they are so entitled they think they have the right to tell killers how to play even after chasing off so many killers that the survivor queue times are now 4 times longer than they were just 6 months ago.

How about running away from pysco hillbillies with chainsaws? This might just be the game for you. Although if you like doing either of those things in the company of friends... well you better have atleast 4 other friends with 20 bucks in their pockets.TLDR Good game would recomend if you like to play soloThe week leading up to the launch of this title I was very excited. Watching a multitude of streamers play this game with their friends made me wish I could do the same. The hype was real. When the game went live a friend of mine and I bought this game anxious to cower in fear at the likes of machette clad macocists. We then spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to play together. Surely there was an \"invite a friend\" option we were over looking. After hosting and rehosting lobbies we discovered no such option exsists... What a let down! Dead By Daylight seems like the perfect platform to have a real horror shared experience with friends but the only way to accomplish this is in a private game. To me this seems like a huge over sight. Now understandably I can see the developers side of this decision. Sure playing this game as a survivor with a friend could lead to some already unbalanced game play however I think that the whole soul of this game revolves around surviving as a group and what better way to experience that than with a friend. In my opinion if the developers were worried about competetive balance they should have just made the match making system allow friends and then work on developing a more competetive game mode in the future.Rant aside let's talk about the game. Overall i really enjoy the game. The ambianceis perfect. The maps are creepy the character modles are pretty terrifying and the mechanics are pretty solid. The feeling you get as a survivor being chased through a cornfield by a psycotic chainsaw massacre ist is second to none. Likewise hunting survivors as a nearly invisible wraith is awesome. Sure there are some balance issues that are being addressed that is fine. I am happy that the developers are quick to patch this title.Dead By Daylight is certainly worth the money with one caveat I hope you like playing by yourself! I however do not and will probably not be playing this game too much until i can actually match make with my friends or somehow convince more of my friends to make the purchase.","title":"Dead by Daylight"},
